"Tank didn’t burst, but leaked at 7.6 bar. This is a good result & supports idea of 304L stainless being better than 301. We’re developing our own alloy to take this even further. Leak before burst is highly desirable."
"Yeah. Merlin, using a single pintle injector with cold, liquid propellant, needs a longer chamber than Raptor, which uses a large number of coaxial injectors, despite Merlin being less than half thrust. Propellant enters Raptor chamber as hot gas that’s already mixed."
Yes

"Important technical note: due to higher O/F of CH4 vs RP1 (oxygen is dense) & significant density increase of subcooled CH4 (plus no common dome insulation needed), plus cryo strength bump of CH4, tank mass of CH4/O2 stage is almost same as RP1/O2."
"We could never reach 380 Isp with RP/kerosene. CH4 has higher Isp potential on paper, but even better in practice. With CH4, you can reach >99% of max theoretical combustion efficiency, but RP is ~97% on a good day & requires desooting of turbines between flights."

"That’s pretty much what happened. The cows weren’t sure what to do (not having encountered a rocket before), so first ran one direction, then the other."
A mandatory tracing app would be insane
TRUE
Probably makes sense to have a “Details” section of the app that mirrors everything in the car. Would also allow phone to be used in lieu of car screen if car screen faults for any reason.

Yes
"Peak rate of about half that for version 1 is about right, but heavily dependent on users per cell. Aiming for latency under 20 ms."
"It will only work for higher latitudes (Seattle) at first, then get progressively closer to the equator"
Sure :)
Way more important than it sounds
Yeah!!
"A fully & rapidly reusable orbital rocket is fundamental to extending life beyond Earth. Propellant cost is roughly a 1000th of vehicle cost (unless using a foolish propellant). Same principle as cars, planes, boats, etc."
SLS makes me feel sad
"No, they will be smashed beyond repair & corroded"
"Yeah, although hydrogen is not a great choice for a booster engine"
A great mystery of the universe
It’s so tragic that these engines just crash into the ocean every flight
"Roundabouts no problem, but dodging distracted human drivers very tricky!"
"Looks about right. Ice mining/refining  on Mars & maximizing total system efficiency will be hard. CO2 is easy, as Mars atmosphere is mostly that. Also has good amount of N2, which is important for life."
"In this case, just chilling the gas back to liquid"
"Yes, converts CO2 & H2O to CH4 & O2. Perfect for Mars!  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabatier_reaction …"

"No, good chance of RUD (rapid unscheduled disassembly) event, but landing pad is separated from launch pad"
That basically describes SoC 0 vs SoC 1 of our FSD computer right now. Soon to change!
So often true 🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/qxmDtZ4Buf
Improved process I was referring to was cylinder to cylinder circumferential welds to improve cycle time & reduce pucker. Those are still working their way through production.
These won’t be strictly coupled to ship serial number. Might be on SN5 or might just be used as a manufacturing pathfinder.
Great labeling tools & talented human labelers really matter. It really is a skilled profession! Importance of good tools & infrastructure is underrated.
"As usual for most things, building production system for Raptor is >1000% harder than designing it"
It’s also because of the Spitfire engine & wizard
Pretty much. Being better than human drivers on average is not a super high standard. Autonomy will probably be held to a 300% to 1000% higher safety requirement long-term.
Progress is good
Definitely
Many talented engineers are working on FSD at Tesla. What matters is solving vision at high frame rate in our compute space with low latency between camera frame & actuation.

Thanks! We are taking some key steps to reduce satellite brightness btw. Should be much less noticeable during orbit raise by changing solar panel angle & all sats get sunshades starting with launch 9.
Makes sense
Nice
Anything surprising?
Numbers I was told from Wuhan were 80% to 90% mortality rate for invasive ventilators. Those are not good odds.

10% would be impressive. Anything below a 20% payload hit would be outstanding.
"I sure hope so! This will inspire the world & get people excited about the future, just as Apollo did. It wasn’t just that a few people went to the moon, they went there for all humankind."
"Another reason reported mortality rate is overstated is that dying *with* covid is not same as dying *from* covid. Media keeps reporting former, not latter."
Maybe 1.5% change to interior dimensions. Still very roomy.
Probably 3 to 6 months
"Moreover, there is mounting evidence that invasive is suboptimal for covid. If they put Boris Johnson on mask ventilator, but *not* invasive, that tells you something!

What I find most surprising is that CNN still exists
“Dr. Levitan advocates combining breathing support from a CPAP machine or regular oxygen with comfortable positioning”. Yup.
“Don’t jump to intubation.” — Dr Caputo https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1250205685868122115 …
"A mask or nose “ventilator” with moderately increased oxygen % will help. This is common in hospitals. Intubation, where a tube is jammed down your throat under sedation & you’re fed high pressure, pure oxygen for several days to weeks is questionable."
Sounds about right https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2020-04-15/are-ventilators-helping-or-harming-covid-19-patients …
Roughly what is the survival rate of intubated patients? I’m hearing 10% to 20%. Is this overly pessimistic?
"I know of two nurses who had their job offers revoked, one in NYC and one in Arlington"
We’re working super hard on getting traffic lights & stops released. Reverse summon (auto park) will be part of the core Autopilot software upgrade for FSD later this year.
"They were, but are they currently?"
Interesting
"We are hearing almost all hospital ICUs have excess capacity. In some cases, 60% empty."
Does seem that early use is wise. Solving late stage C19 probably requires two or three mechanisms of action.
Sure
"Production is by *far* the hard part. That’s why I’m not super worried about early Starship failures. Initial serial numbers are suboptimal, so would be lawn ornaments if they survived. That said, as lawn ornaments go, they’re pretty sweet …"
"SN4 won’t get flaps, so can only do flights with engine on. Just did a reset this week on flap, actuator & static aero design. Either SN5 or SN6 will get flaps."
That’s for sure! 😅
I have great respect for anyone who gets a rocket to orbit! It’s very hard. I’m spending crazy hours on Starship design/production. It is truly an honor to work with such great engineers. SN4 is almost done 😀
My (again) personal favorite is https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/japanese-flu-drug-clearly-effective-in-treating-coronavirus-says-china …
"Some of the small launcher activity is cool, especially @rocketlab. Downsides are helicopter retrieval doesn’t scale to bigger rockets & is highly weather-dependent. Also, propulsive landing is needed for moon/Mars. That said, it’s probably right move for small LEO vehicle."
"Vast majority of “ventilators” are not intratracheal, but, yes, jamming a pipe down a patient’s throat & driving in high pressure, pure oxygen is definitely not how we evolved! My personal choice would be mask with moderate pressure at ~50% O2. https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2020-04-15/are-ventilators-helping-or-harming-covid-19-patients …"

"Merlin is arguably version 6 or 7 by now. It’s a real workhorse, but looks so simple next to Raptor!"
"The way things are looking right now, the world will soon be flooded with excess ventilators. Even NY is giving them away!"
"Fundamentally, Atlas is still dependent on Russia to launch"
"Yeah, Atlas main engine is Russian. Great engine, but not US. Also, their fairing is Swiss. I think interstage & payload separation system also not US."
"Tesla actually sent out ResMed, Philips & Medtronic units. Latter is fully intratracheal. My personal opinion is that some ICUs are jumping the gun on intubation & setting PEEP & O2 too high. High pressure, pure oxygen increases risk of lung damage. pic.twitter.com/2IUnS5DPOg"
"Sorry, meant to say only US rocket. Atlas V is close, but not yet 100%."
"Tesla *was* saved by an investment in May 2009 from Daimler, not govt. Without that Daimler support, Tesla would have died. Super appreciated!"
"Exactly. In mid 2009, Tesla received non-binding approval for loan program actually signed into law by Bush in late 2008. First actual disbursement was Q2 2010, long after BK danger passed. Loan was repaid early with interest. Taxpayers made money on it!!"
"Last I checked, over a million dollars less. Moreover, F9 is launching far more often & is only rocket fully NASA-approved for launching astronauts, so that gap is increasing."
"Also, it costs less $ to insure a Falcon 9 mission. That’s the acid test."
"True. Only reason other medium & heavy lift rocket companies are winning any missions at all is due to govt intervention. Otherwise, they’d be as defunct as expendable airplane companies. ULA is powered by lobbying."
"To be clear, Fremont & Shanghai will also be upgraded over time, but it’s hard to retrofit these improvements to an operating paint shop"
Initial production at Giga Berlin is Model Y
You will be able to wrap it in any color or pattern
"There’s tough competition for that title, but we will give it our best shot!"
"Giga Berlin will have world’s most advanced paint shop, with more layers of stunning colors that subtly change with curvature"
This will happen
We stole that from cheetahs
"In case it’s not already obvious, our product plan is basically stolen from Spaceballs"

Certainly no problem for a 144 trillion operations per second computer to make ~15 steering/acceleration/braking maneuvers per second. That’s a trillion calculations between each output command.

"Rockets & spacecraft have to operate in vacuum, so maintaining pressure is fundamental. However, this can be made very safe over time imo."
There are redundant pressure control valves. It’s a new system and SN3 was simply commanded wrong. Rockets are hard.
"If you lose pressure control on rocket propellant tanks, you’re doomed anyway, so might as well go all in"
We’re adding this here catchy tune to the music maker in the Tesla!

Yes. PCB design techniques applied to create a heat exchanger that is physically impossible by normal means. Heat pump also has a local heating loop to spool up fast & extend usable temperature range. Octavalve is pretty special too. Team did great work. No credit to me.

This is great advice
Thanks for taking delivery in your garage! Let us know if there’s anything else you need.
"We expect to have over ~1200 to distribute this week. Getting them delivered, installed & operating is the harder part."
Supply chain logistics — getting masks & other PPE to the right places in time  — is the main issue we’re hearing from ER physicians
You’re most welcome. We’re working on getting other types of PPE too. Ventilators should arrive within a few days.
Panic is always dumb
"Italy: “On re-evaluation by the National Institute of Health, only 12 per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus.”"
"Close contact family gatherings that mix young kids, who have almost no risk of C19 death, with grandparents who have high risk (especially those with prior lung damage), are one of the most powerful mortality vectors"
We have N95 masks & getting PAPRs. Will have our team reach out.
Just had a long engineering discussion with Medtronic about state-of-the-art ventilators. Very impressive team!
No problem :)
"Sigmoid (S-curve) is how all physical and mental viruses behave, regardless of containment. Containment reduces asymptote of S-curve. At this point, we have strict containment in US/Europe & should expect similarly reduced asymptote to China."

Fair point :)
"Exactly, both would be false positive. Also, dying with C19 is different from dying because of C19. Vast majority who died had other illnesses too. pic.twitter.com/YKMW54q2kL"
Up to 80% false positive
"Sure, although ventilator companies definitely know how to make ventilators. Just a spike in demand right now. Also, using CPAP machines for less severe cases & using one ventilator for several patients seem like good moves to meet short-term demand."
Do you have data on the false positive rate? I’ve heard a wide range of numbers. CDC numbers are almost an order of magnitude lower between high fidelity data (onset date known) and “presumed positive”. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html …

Software just thinks the car is less efficient than it actually is
Many small hardware improvements throughout the car that have been introduced gradually over past several months
Maybe possible with improved wheels/tires (which would be available to all previously made cars)
All S/X cars made in recent months have actually been above stated EPA range. Will be unlocked soon for free via software update.

The degree to which SolarGlass will positively effect the esthetics & energy sustainability of neighborhoods throughout the world is not yet well appreciated. This is a very important product.
"Tesla April company talk will be from our Giga New York factory, where we make SolarGlass & several other products. Will also offer customer & media tours."
Should preface this saying that feedback from early Tesla Solar roof owners has been v positive. It’s stunning vs a regular roof in person imo. Photos don’t do it justice.
"Its integrated roof & solar, so should be light enough for almost any home"
Coming hopefully later this year
"I think will still be better than a normal roof, but adding a heating grid to automatically remove ice & snow sounds like a good option. We have that already on car windows!"
"No problem. Snow and ice tend to slide off the Tesla SolarGlass due to lower surface roughness, so accumulates less than a normal roof. Even so, it’s very strong and can be walked on without breaking the glass tiles."
Sounds should note that it gets less shiny automatically due to dust & weathering. This pic is brand new.
Ok
Sounds like we should open a Tesla Center there!
Please let us know what improvements we can make to any aspect of Tesla SolarGlass roof! Critical feedback is much appreciated.

You’re welcome! Was a fun recruiting event. Great to see all the excitement about helping build Starships.
"Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. Hopper, for example, was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for SN1 orbital design. Optimized skins will be <2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter."
"No, they’re SN1. SN2 to follow shortly. Aiming to be a little better each time."
"Yes, we’re tuning weld parameters to reduce puckering & building a heavy duty planisher to flatten & cold work the weld area"
"That said, although substantial capital & engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because it’s built inside a factory in volume."
"This isn’t quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision that’s 3X to 4X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures & welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving."

"First, we need to make it super safe & easy to use, then determine greatest utility vs risk. From initially working to volume production & implantation is a long road. As with vehicle safety, it will be much harder to pass our internal standards than minimum regulatory standards."

PyTorch is the most frequently used external tool set/library
"Our NN is initially in Python for rapid iteration, then converted to C++/C/raw metal driver code for speed (important!). Also, tons of C++/C engineers needed for vehicle control & entire rest of car. Educational background is irrelevant, but all must pass hardcore coding test."
"The profound impact of high bandwidth, high precision neural interfaces is underappreciated. Neuralink may have this in a human as soon as this year. Just needs to be unequivocally better than Utah Array, which is already in some humans & has severe drawbacks."
Sorry!
A PhD is definitely not required. All that matters is a deep understanding of AI & ability to implement NNs in a way that is actually useful (latter point is what’s truly hard). Don’t care if you even graduated high school.
"Not needed, but will be very useful on Mars due to light speed latency"

"Dojo, our training supercomputer, will be able to process vast amounts of video training data & efficiently run hypersparce arrays with a vast number of parameters, plenty of memory & ultra-high bandwidth between cores. More on this later."
"Our custom 144 TOPS in-vehicle inference computer, where almost every TOP is useable & optimized for NN, far exceeds anything else in volume production, giving you the hardware you need to run sophisticated nets"
"Tesla will soon have over a million connected vehicles worldwide with sensors & compute needed for full self-driving, which is orders of magnitude more than everyone else combined, giving you the best possible dataset to work with"

"Exactly. Mars propellant production will combine atmospheric CO2 & water (ice) to make CH4 (methane) & O2. Will do same on Earth long-term. Short-term, each Falcon flight uses roughly same fuel mass as a 747 flight. Falcon is ~71% oxygen & Starship is ~78%, so mostly not fuel."

Yes
That’s the goal
Building 100 Starships/year gets to 1000 in 10 years or 100 megatons/year or maybe around 100k people per Earth-Mars orbital sync
"Starship design goal is 3 flights/day avg rate, so ~1000 flights/year at >100 tons/flight, so every 10 ships yield 1 megaton per year to orbit"
Megatons per year to orbit are needed for life to become multiplanetary
That’s about right

"What’s amazing is how non-linear the effect of gravity is. Starship can travel by itself from surface of Mars to surface of Earth, but requires massive booster on Earth with orbital refilling to get to Mars, which is ~38% of Earth gravity."
"Densification isn’t needed to return the ship & limited cargo from Mars, but it’s an option for increasing cargo return capability if needed"
"Fundamental issue with SLS is that it’s not reusable, which means that a billion dollar rocket is blown up every launch! 💯 tragedy."
"Densifying hydrogen is difficult, as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero. Much easier with CH4, which is an underappreciated advantage. Cooling O2 is good too, but becomes operationally difficult at N2 liquid temp, as air is ~78% N2. Entire system wants to drip air!"

Every tank under pressure is a balloon tank — it’s just question of degree. Starship tanks are not balloon tanks like Atlas in sense that they don’t collapse when depressurized on the ground.
"Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4."
A given tank pressure is needed to feed the engine turbopumps & pressure-stabilize/relieve compression load on the cylinder walls
"Dome to barrel weld made it to 7.1 bar, which is pretty good as ~6 bar is needed for orbital flight. With more precise parts & better welding conditions, we should reach ~8.5 bar, which is the 1.4 factor of safety needed for crewed flight."

"Absolutely. Multi-level tunnels can go under buildings, mountains, rivers or anything else & directly connect destinations, like aircraft do in the sky. We just need more of them."
Pretty much
Sure. Trax will get much better & more fun. This is an alpha version.
"No, I said we should build more tunnels. Put trains in them or cars or whatever, but every large city on Earth is plagued by traffic & it’s getting worse. Multi-level tunnels might solve this, so worth trying. If you have a better suggestion, please tell us what it is."
"That might have something to do with it. “Stalin: Court of the Red Tsar” was one of the few books so dark I had to stop reading. If only they’d listened to Lenin’s last wish, much tragedy may have been averted."
"For sure, but I understand the pulse of Twitter pretty well. A sudden avalanche of very similar vitriolic comments from anon accounts usually means someone activated a troll/bot net."

"To pay rent, we turned our house into a nightclub & charged a $5 entry fee. Looked cool at night, but insane by day … blacklights, luminescent spray paint & metal junk sculptures."

Sounds like a Marxist with style
Exactly
"Induced demand is one of the most irrational theories I’ve ever heard. Correlation is not causation. If the transport system exceeds public travel needs, there will be very little traffic. I support anything that improves traffic, as this negatively affects almost everyone."
"This is a pretty awful lie. I left South Africa by myself when I was 17 with just a backpack & suitcase of books. Worked on my Mom’s cousin’s farm in Saskatchewan & a lumber mill in Vancouver. Went to Queens Univ with scholarship & debt, then same to UPenn/Wharton & Stanford."
"This person blocked me, so can’t read the tweet. Whats their deal?"
"We started Zip2 with ~$2k from me plus my overclocked home-built PC, ~$5k from my bro & ~$8k from Greg Kouri (such a good guy — he is greatly missed).

My Dad provided 10% of a ~$200k angel funding round much later, but by then risk was reduced & round would’ve happened anyway."
"He didn’t own an emerald mine & I worked my way through college, ending up ~$100k in student debt. I couldn’t even afford a 2nd PC at Zip2, so programmed at night & website only worked during day. Where is this bs coming from?"

Probably 2021. Depends on regulatory approvals.
Hopefully working in Caribbean by end of 2020. Def by 2021.
"Maximizing conversion of mass to aimed photons (pure momentum) is actually the highest possible efficiency, which is why an antimatter drive is probably the best way to get to other star systems with known physics. For “close” stars, a laser sail is good too."

Hopefully fully operational in 2020
"Boring Co is completing its first commercial tunnel in Vegas, going from Convention Center to Strip, then will work on other projects"

The overarching goal of Tesla engineering is maximize area under user happiness curve
"It’s not that these things can’t be done, they just absorb a lot of software engineering time, which has great opportunity cost. There are very few excellent software engineers & merely increasing team size results in awful bloatware."
Future feature
"Turn on auto navigate feature & car will activate traffic-based navigation to work, home or calendar, depending on context, as soon as you sit down. No input required at all."
"Possible, but one step at a time. Anything we release to the fleet has big implications these days. For example, if someone’s on data roaming & video is enabled, they will get a giant cell phone bill. Operating in 40+ countries results in many corner cases!"
"Seeing B pillar (diagonal fwd) & side repeater (diagonal back) camera views would probably help for tight situations. We can enable access to these views. Also, no problem to have option to disable auto lock for home."
We’re building out Superchargers as fast as possible! Need to ramp V3 Supercharger production.
Phone notification with ability to view possibly relevant still images is no problem. Live video from several cameras is too much bandwidth.
Most people still don’t know it’s there
"Just swipe down on Tesla nav button for car to automatically navigate to home, work or destination in calendar"
"If you enter a longer distance than range, system should autonav to optimal Superchargers along the way. Is it not doing this correctly?"
"Merry Christmas 🎄🎁😀
Hope you’re enjoying latest software update!"
Yer welcome son
"Car should autonavigate to destinations based on your calendar. If nothing in calendar, should do work in morning & home in evening. Future versions will guess based on prior patterns (if preference enabled)."

We can prob reduce width by an inch & maybe reduce length by 6+ inches without losing on utility or esthetics. Min height is below 75 inches when air suspension set to low. Will post exact number soon.

Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.
"SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle & no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year."
"Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn’t consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!"
Pretty much
"Exactly! It’s also a far more exciting & inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far)."
"No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous & difficult than Earth & take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That’s the sales pitch. Want to go?"
"So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable"
As the planets align only once every two years
A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what’s hard.
"Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half"
"If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles & each does 100 tons to orbit, that’s a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year"
"Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it’s designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year"

Fair point. Coming soon. We’re making foundational upgrades to the core Tesla corporate OS. 2FA right after that.
"Connected, autonomous cars require great software. Advanced factories also require great software. The car industry is not very good at software."

Yes
Would be odd to expect anything else
"That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth"
"Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days & requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours & ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed."
Great poem

Anyone who’s interested in working on cutting edge manufacturing — designing & building the machine that makes the machine — please consider working at Tesla or SpaceX. We’re gonna take this to a whole new level!
Tesla team has done an incredible job with Giga Shanghai. Honored to work with them. I’m in awe.
"So much respect for those doing high volume manufacturing. It’s insanely hard, but you make a real thing that people value. My hat is off to you …"
"Tesla is first American car company to achieve sustained volume production in past ~100 years. Hardest, most painful thing I’ve ever been through, including getting Falcon to orbit."
"Prototypes are easy, but achieving volume production of a new technology is insanely hard"
And the lead character is also named Woody pic.twitter.com/ZxK84rB020
"Yeah, gimbal SL engines at min throttle for control, so most of impulse goes through vac engines"
Conservation of energy tells you the answer
Looking forward to Kerbal 2!
"We def could be wrong about this, but it’s actually good to fix high efficiency vacuum engines with giant nozzles in place & only thrust vector engines with smaller nozzles. Don’t need a lot of room & moment of inertia is much lower."
"Also, we’re keeping area ratio low enough to fire Raptor Vac at sea level without flow separation, so that’s leaving a lot on the table"
"Couple months, but V1.0 of Raptor Vac is suboptimal, as optimized for speed of development. Isp maybe 365 to 370 sec."
"Max thrust version of Raptor should achieve true T/W > 170. Target is 1.5 ton engine with >260 t-F. Max Isp version should achieve ~380 sec, but T/W probably <120 due to big nozzle. These are just guesses for now."
Oberth effect is not well appreciated. Value of high thrust low in gravity well is not captured in simple delta-v equation. One of the reasons we favor CH4 over H2.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect …
"This is true. All that matters is number used in ∆v equation. Propellant residuals are incredibly important, often overwhelming engine mass.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v "
"Big challenge for Starship refueling on the moon is finding sources of carbon. Probably some pretty big deposits in craters from meteorites. Same goes for hydrogen & oxygen, also in (shadowed) craters."
"We’re working on a simple initial version of Autopark. Will be safe, but sometimes park in silly places that aren’t actual parking spaces."
"Yeah, great team!"
"To be precise, r is distance from center of masses of two objects. Center of mass of Earth is ~6400km, so gravity change is small at Space Station altitude, which is ~6800km from center of Earth. pic.twitter.com/21hICWczMq"
"Exactly. And you can on the moon, since it has no atmosphere."
"Most people aren’t aware that orbit (and “zero” gravity) is all about horizontal speed, not altitude. A spacecraft needs to travel about 25 times the speed of sound to stay in space."
"Yeah, will be Raptor vertical test stand. Hopefully allows simplification of Raptor design, as pump shaft wear & drainage is better in vertical config. Also, more representive of flight. Test as you fly …"

Should be much better at this point
Price for fully installed solar plus battery has been reduced ~10% to help those affected by blackouts
"Yes, but probably a year or two away. Lot of fish to fry …"
"Tesla cannot continue to lose money. To achieve our goal of environmental sustainability, Tesla must be financially sustainable or we will cease to exist."
Allows homeowner potential to go completely off grid
"V important: pure solar subscription is guaranteed to be a net money-maker for the homeowner or Tesla will take the panels back. Adding Powerwall negatively affects economics, but gives homeowner power protection in event of a blackout."
"When the car is FSD without supervision, ie robotaxi, you’ll be able to earn far more than monthly lease/loan cost by allowing others to use it. Managing a small fleet of robotaxis will be a career for many & much better than driving a single car."
Putting panels on east or west facing roofs works well too. Energy loss is fairly minor. Just north facing that’s problematic above ~30 deg latitude.
😉
"Working with engineering team to figure out best way to do upgrade without crushing service team. Will start doing upgrades in volume in a few months, coincident with more FSD features being released."
"Still working with RDW, the car regulatory authority in Netherlands. Unclear why there’s a delay. Other countries are supportive."
"Now that Tesla V10.0 with Smart Summon is out, Full Self-Driving price will increase by $1000 on Nov 1"

There’s so much power going through this engine that it’s close to the limit of the known physics of materials in many places
Yes
"Well, hopefully closer to 300 bar over time. However, that the chamber/nozzle jacket has so many joints & dissimilar metals at such high pressure & temperature is what I find remarkable about it."
"No, we’ve been focusing on production (now on SN12). Only need 250 bar or even a bit less for Starship/Super Heavy. Anything above 250 is nice to have & we’ll get around to it, but not needed for flight."
Probably around 6 or 7pm

"Exactly. For reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat."

Approximately correct. We also fire the ACS thrusters to rotate the vehicle & ignite Raptors at full gimbal angle to complete the turn.
"For aero control, it comes down to % of cross-sectional area moving vs not. Flexible as to whether front or rear, so long as within bounds of center of mass & pressure."
"Current analysis, which I’m not fully bought into, suggests that 2 rear fins with separate airframe-mounted legs will be lighter, so this is the plan for Mk1/Mk2"
"Stability is controlled by (very) rapid movement of rear & fwd fins during entry & landing, as well as ACS thrusters. The smaller leeward “fin” would simply be used as a leg."
Stability is not an issue with 3
"Nose tip has forward movable fins, cold gas attitude control thrusters, header tanks for landing, composite pressure vessels, several large batteries, etc. Placed up there to balance high mass of Raptors & rear fins at the bottom."
"Yes. There’s a huge amount of hardware in the tip of the faring that being integrated on the ground, which is why we haven’t closed it out."

"Exactly! We’ve only one car factory in California & one Gigafactory (for batteries & drive units) in Nevada. Giga Shanghai will do cars, batteries & drive units for the greater China area. Over time, regional Gigafactories will lower costs & improve logistics worldwide."
"Should note that these product mix & logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK & Ireland right now, but we don’t raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win."
"That’s not to say that Tesla people somewhere in the world are being overzealous & possibly overstepping our core principles, which is why I’m looking into it"
"At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes & logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances."
"The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally & should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world."
Agreed
"Going to early access (including all who bought FSD) Tesla owners in US next week. If US early access rollout looks good, then rest of world early access owners following week. Might be some delays in EU for regulatory approval."
"There aren’t really meant to be “Tesla incentives”, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all."
"Looking into this. A fundamental premise of Tesla is that everyone is offered same terms at same time, ie what you get should never be a function of bargaining."

Looks good
The mechanical attachment mechanism. We need to make sure they won’t fall off due to vibration & acoustics.

"The hex tiles are actually mechanically attached, which is important to allow for very high temp on back side of tile that would destroy any adhesive. Marshmellow-looking thing is a rope seal."
"Failure rate is actually both higher & lower than that, as the Falcon 9 design has changed almost completely several times. Currently flying version has no failures (may fate continue to be merciful), but older versions therefore have a higher failure rate."
Precisely
"Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven’t moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, you’ll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox & fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, you’re prob ok."
🤣🤣
You know destination weather before departure & there’s no weather in space
"Everything happens so fast. It’s such a different paradigm that applying aircraft concepts to rockets is almost like applying shipping concepts to aircraft. Travels 10,000 km in 30 mins."
"Not currently planning for pad abort with early Starships, but maybe we should. Vac engines would be dual bell & fixed (no gimbal), which means we can stabilize nozzle against hull."
"Raptor turbines can spin up extremely fast. We take it easy on the test stand, but that’s not indicative of capability."
"Over time, 355 & 385 are possible, but very difficult"
Most likely
Photoshop is amazing
"Sea level Raptor’s vacuum Isp is ~350 sec, but ~380 sec with larger vacuum-optimized nozzle"
For sure

Everyone who bought FSD will receive priority/early access
"Price increase for Tesla FSD postponed until version 10 with smart summon is in wide release, which is about 4 to 8 weeks away, depending on how early access goes"
"Not risky imo & can be adjusted/improved real-time. Essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as Mars is slightly too far from this solar system’s fusion reactor (the sun)."
"True, diverting a comet would be super hard. Could be done with small asteroids & a mass driver, but this is risky."
"Nuke Mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. Much like our sun, this would not cause Mars to become radioactive."
"Will probably make sense to do this when Starship Mk 1 has 3 Raptors, moving body fins & landing gear installed, which is hopefully mid September"
Will be converted to Raptor vertical test stand
"Trickier than it may seem on Mars, as atmospheric density is 1% that of Earth & gravity is 38%, but doable for localized warming"

"As mentioned earlier this year, cost of the Tesla FSD option will increase every few months. Those who buy it earlier will see the benefit."
Probably
Agreed. That’s approximately date when we expect Enhanced Summon to be in wide release. It will be magical. Lot of hard work by Autopilot team.
Cost of Tesla full self-driving option increasing by ~$1000 on August 16
"Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you can’t make enough of them & we won’t be able to."
"No, since Tesla will charge a % fee for being in our robotaxi fleet, but it will rise to whatever the clearing price is, otherwise all our cars will be bought by scalpers"
"If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving, as planned, any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week"
Basic white adds too much to service repair complexity. Team convinced me better to go with pearl white.

"Yes, but owner will have to accept tiny risk of damage. Those are very hard even for careful human drivers."
"Yeah, that’s next after summon"
"Will trace back inertial measurements & wheel movements to exit multilevel garage, unless car was teleported into position, in which case all bets are off"
"Initially, single plane, but hopefully multi-story later this year"
Probably 5mph or 8 km/h
Good progress on fast activation of summon down to ~1 second
Parking lots are a remarkably hard problem. Doing an in-depth engineering review of Enhanced Summon later today.

"There is no “refreshed” Model X or Model S coming, only a series of minor ongoing changes. Most significant change in past few years was to use high efficiency Model 3 rear drive unit as S/X front drive unit. That went into production 3 months ago."

Exactly
Sure 🤖 🚘 😀
"To be clear, consumers will still be able to buy a Tesla, but the clearing price will rise significantly, as a fully autonomous car that can function as a robotaxi is several times more valuable than a non-autonomous car"
"Between first development engine & first flight engine with operational payload, there are always hundreds of changes to both hardware & software. Over time, thousands."
Upgrading to 250kW soon
"Intersections with complex traffic lights & shopping mall parking lots are the two biggest software challenges. Developer branch already mostly works in these scenarios, but massive effort required to get to 99.9999% safety."
Local supporters will be invited!
Yes
~Q4 2016
"End of Q4, most likely"
"Production fully switched over ~3 months ago. Functionality won’t diverge until Q4, as it’s limited by software validation. Will be later for Europe compared to rest of world due to regulatory constraints that were put in place years ago by big ICE companies."
This is why it’s possible for Tesla to have a million robotaxis by end of 2020 if we upgrade existing HW2 fleet of ~500k & make at least ~500k FSD cars
All HW2+ cars are upgradable to full self-driving capability with Tesla FSD computer & all production in past few months has FSD computer

2.1. sec 0-60 mph is base model before adding rocket thruster option
That’s actually kinda true
Almost anything. Length/diameter is much lower & Starship doesn’t have a hammerhead fairing that acts like main sail.
You’re touching on a good critique of Falcon 9. Our 1st stage to 2nd stage propellant ratio is too high. We’re fixing that with Starship.
"That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney’s Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you’d exit on another continent."
"~1000, as all seats would be “coach” & no toilets, pilot area or food galley needed. Most flights would only be 15 to 20 mins. It’s basically an ICBM traveling at Mach 25 that lands."
"About 100, assuming people want cabins. Pressurized volume is similar to A380. Could take a lot more on shorter trips."
"That was our design approach in early days, but fairing mass is much higher & stability of booster in ground winds is low"
There will be no Block 6. Moving to Starship architecture.
"Frangible would def hurt reusability. Also, presumably those quarter sections are actuated or aero control will be impossible."
"Good to see this. Splitting interstage into 4 sections will have some challenges, but could work."
Probably sooner
Ok
"Sure, that would be an honor"
Most likely. It is programmed to do so.
High entry force & heat breached engine bay & center engine TVC failed

"Yes, but we couldn’t take a chance on 2nd stage failing it’s 4th maneuver. This mission was more complex than anything I’m aware of in history of rockets. RIP center core, you did your duty well."
Ms. Tree caught the Falcon fairing!!
High payload/delta-V missions will always be far downrange. Value of boost stage is measured (essentially) by *horizontal* velocity imparted to upper stage. Altitude is almost unimportant.
Center core RUD. It was a long shot.

"All Raptors have slight throttle range by adjusting flow to ox & fuel turbines, but deep throttling imposes limitations on injector stiffness & needs extra hardware. Swear these are legit technical terms 🤗"
It’s a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
"Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock & strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor."
"Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more"
Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals & bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.
So cool
Anything with high contrast
Excessive shades of grey
"Yeah, we’ve been working on curbs a *lot*. Concrete seams too. So glamorous."
"Other rocket engines were designed for no (or almost no) reuse. Raptor is designed for heavy & immediate reuse, like an aircraft jet engine, with inspections required only after many flights, assuming instrumentation shows it good. Using hydrostatic bearings certainly helps."
Third revision of Enhanced Summon hopefully going to Tesla owners with early access later this week
Haha
Depends on destination
"Planning on a simplifying mod to Raptor for max thrust, but no throttling, to get to 250 mT level"
"Since Raptor produces 200 tons of force, cost per ton would be $1000. However, Raptor is designed for ~1000 flights with negligible maintenance, so cost per ton over time would actually be ~$1."
Chomsky sucks
"Yet another Monty Python reference, possibly my favorite https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=R7qT-C-0ajI …"
Anarcho-syndicalism FTW!!
"More than that now, but <10% of that in volume, although much to be proven"
"Full year production is usually ~70% of peak daily rate, so 500/year. Still, non-trivial at 100,000 tons of thrust/year."
"Raptor liberated its oxygen turbine stator (appears to be mechanical, not metal combustion failure), so we need to update the design & replace some parts. Production is ramping exponentially, though. SN6 almost done. Aiming for an engine every 12 hours by end of year."

"Based on our data, Autopilot miles appear to be twice as safe as manually driven miles, and we expect this to improve further"
Tesla is affecting powerful vested interests. Big auto & oil companies aren’t known for their gentle behavior. SpaceX is battling US military prime contractors & space programs of national govts. No walk in the park there.
"Yeah, *way* better. Dramatically improves cost, complexity & ease of operations. Distances of ~10,000 km with decent payload seem achievable at roughly Mach 20."
"Add 2 to 4 more Raptors for Starship point to point on Earth. You can go surprisingly far, even with low lift/drag. This was an unexpected result."

"Agreed, sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. We’ll get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits & arrays are tracking to sun."
"Exactly, potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good. That said, we’ll make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. We care a great deal about science."
Rotate on one axis. Magnetic torque rods for desaturation of momentum wheels.

"There are already 4900 satellites in orbit, which people notice ~0% of the time. Starlink won’t be seen by anyone unless looking very carefully & will have ~0% impact on advancements in astronomy.

"No, Raptor uses a large number of coaxial swirl injectors, which (we believe) achieves highest theoretical mixing/combustion efficiency."

Super proud of SpaceX propulsion/test/materials team! One of hardest technology problems. New high temp superalloy & internal foundry needed to make it work. Foundry iteration interval is ~3 weeks from design to flight part vs ~36 weeks typical for aerospace.
Only a tiny amount. There is enough air to affect the satellites & allow some amount of yaw steering.
"Propellant stays same, but almost everything else improves. Fundamental goal is minimize cost per ton to surface of Mars."
"Great video. Couple notes: Raptor designed for subcooled CH4/O2, so propellant density & thrust increase up to ~8%, as needed for mission. 380 Isp & up to 50% thrust/weight improvement over time. Merlin thrust/weight doubled from V1, but Raptor is closer to optimum."

"Opposite is true: you can have 100’s of layers of tunnels, but only one layer on surface (to first approximation), therefore trains should be on surface, cars below"
"Yes, but you get to your destination so quickly & directly that it doesn’t matter"
"Exactly. Still, pretty wild that the engine plume can climb up the side of a rocket going hypersonic speed!"
Paperwork & hundreds of approving authorities is by far the hardest part
"LA has a subway, but most people don’t know about it"
That would great!
Yes. No one will forced to take the tunnel. It’s optional!

"Ironically, same publications will attack me for compensation tied to Tesla tripling in value and imply Tesla is worthless. They can’t *both* be true!"
Gary the 🐌 still crushes us! Wouldn’t be fair. But TBC might give him a run for his money next year.
Fundamental advantage of layers of tunnels is you can have as many lanes as you want going in any direction. Will feel like folding space from one part of a city to another.
This is simple and just works
Pretty much

"Yes, will be used for rear cargo storage. Also helps manage center of mass for heavy payloads when forward cargo is full."
Outer engines are attached to the edge of the airframe to give the center engines room to move

"Turbines on hot side (outer fan-looking things in this depiction), but this is just to illustrate the type of engine. Our turbopumps are vertical, have 3 fan-looking things on pump side & complex cross-flow. Liquid oxygen turbopump is integrated with main combustion chamber."

Vacuum nozzle engines are only used in (near) vacuum conditions. Sea level engines need to gimbal rapidly & at high angle for landing. Larger nozzle leaves less room to move & increases moment of inertia.

Not good enough yet. Pushing release by a few weeks. Will be amazing.
Incorrect. Pana cell lines at Giga are only at ~24GWh/yr & have been a constraint on Model 3 output since July. No choice but to use other suppliers for Powerwall/Powerpack cells. Tesla won’t spend money on more capacity until existing lines get closer to 35GWh theoretical.

Sentry Mode is barely at V1.0. Will improve a lot in coming months.
Impressive analysis
"Only external cameras are being used right now, so internal is not enabled. When it is enabled, we’ll add a setting to disable internal camera."
"Also, it can be used to supplement cameras on outside of vehicle, as it can see through 2nd side windows & rear window."
"It’s there for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft & people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet. In case someone messes up your car, you can check the video."

Night mode default brightness is actually too high imo. Should be lower & allow below current “0%” level. Making that adjustment too.
Agreed
Night mode with 0% brightness is actually too dark during the day. This is ultimately our fault. We will update our software so that 0% brightness is always usable relative to ambient conditions.

"Also the intense low frequency vibrations that you can’t hear, but you can feel in your chest"
"We’re going to try. Side boosters come back to Cape, center core lands on droneship. Latter will be coming in v hot & fast, so dicey."
"Annoying that @ULA perpetuates myth that Delta IV Heavy or Atlas V can do some orbits that Falcon Heavy can’t. This is absolutely false. FH would have to go full expendable for GEO direct, but that’s very rare."
"Yeah, Falcon Heavy Block 5 has way more performance than last year’s vehicle. Lot of room to increase side booster load transfer & max Q without changing any parts. FH Block 5 can launch more payload to any orbit than any vehicle currently flying."
"Probably no fairing either & just 3 Raptor Vacuum engines. Mass ratio of ~30 (1200 tons full, 40 tons empty) with Isp of 380. Then drop a few dozen modified Starlink satellites from empty engine bays with ~1600 Isp, MR 2. Spread out, see what’s there. Not impossible."
"Retrofits will start when our software is able to take meaningful advantage of the Tesla FSD computer, which is an order of magnitude more capable. For now, it’s slightly disadvantageous to have Tesla FSD computer, as our software is more refined for HW2."
Anyone who bought FSD will get it
"Anyone who purchased full self-driving will get FSD computer upgrade for free. This is the only change between Autopilot HW2.5 & HW3. Going forward “HW3” will just be called FSD Computer, which is accurate. No change to vehicle sensors or wire harness needed. This is v important. https://twitter.com/samscho/status/1110649850188558336 …"
Yes. Sensitive propulsion & avionics remained dry. Great work by SpaceX Dragon engineering team. Major improvement over Dragon 1.

"Falcon rocket booster is aluminum-lithium & carbon fiber, which have low max temperature allowables. Super Heavy booster is stainless steel. Since it only goes to around Mach 8 or 9, moreover at high altitude, it needs no heat shield, not even paint."

"Rest of SpaceX propulsion still very active, so only ~50 full-time equivalent people right now. That will grow a lot as we enter production. It’s 10X harder (at least) to design engine production system than engine. In automotive, 100X harder."
"Maybe active in a month or so. Focus right now is getting to high speed, tight follow distance in test tunnel."
"Yes, exciting potential"
Exactly
"Printers are too small. Also, high pressure, high efficiency engines need copper cooling channels with an inco/steel jacket. Can’t print yet."
Exactly. This has now happened several times. Something is broken with SEC oversight.
"Tom did an awesome job leading Merlin, Kestrel, Draco & other engine developments from start through 2014 that were critical to SpaceX’s success. Great respect & appreciation!"
"Thank you Evelyn, I loved it"
"Indeed. I have great respect for judges. It’s not perfect, but, in general, we should be very glad of the US justice system."

Great meme review hosted by Will Smith https://twitter.com/grandayy/status/1099037391669653509 …
Haha true
It’s designed to be way better. We’ll see what reality has to say about that.
"Yes, lot of risk"
"Guys, I have feelings … 😜"
Focusing on Starship instead
Deorbits & burns up over the Pacific
"Upper stage is flight, except mass sim in place of Merlin. It will get fragged for sure by aero loads & Dragon abort thrusters."
"Including Heavy, which is 3 cores, around 20 or so"
"Depends on when Crew Dragon comes back. That’s scheduled for launch next Saturday, but lot of new hardware, so time error bars are big."
"High probability of this particular rocket getting destroyed by Dragon supersonic abort test. Otherwise, at least 20 or 30 missions for Falcon 9. Starship will take over before the F9 fleet reaches end of life."
Crew Dragon high altitude abort test
Yes 😀
Highest reentry heating to date. Burning metal sparks from base heat shield visible in landing video. Fourth relight scheduled for April. https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1098762992848535553 …
Always liked Kestrel. It was the Robin Hood of engines.
"Advanced, reusable rockets are all we need to become a multiplanet civilization. Once we have a city on Mars, interplanetary travel will create a forcing function for vast improvements in spaceflight."
SN2 has changes that should help
To the first part. I doubt we’d create a Dyson ring or sphere.
Yes
"Merlins. The max chamber pressure run damaged Raptor SN 1 (as expected). A lot of the parts are fine for reuse, but next tests will be with SN 2, which is almost done."
"Anti-matter production would require vast amounts of energy. No need though. We have a super reliable, massive, free fusion reactor called the sun."
"Exactly. Super money move is anti-matter drive, especially if you solve capturing antiprotons in deep space."
You can see the streaks on the vacuum Merlin nozzle in flight videos
Pinter injector tends to have hot & cold streaks. Hot streaks burn a rut at the throat that accelerates erosion.
"Essentially, yes. Great engineering talent, but should focus on reusable rockets for purpose of a permanent human base on the moon and self-sustaining city on Mars."
"We are constrained by the accredited investor rule, but will think about how this could be done"
"Yeah, that was a bit embarrassing ☺️High engine chamber pressure and ablative don’t get along. Ok for low pressure, expendable upper stage."
"That’s true 😀 Merlin 1A was terrible. 1C was ok, 1D good, but block 5 Merlin (should probably be called 1E) is something special. Took about 15 years to get there."
"Actually, they received (and still receive) almost a billion dollars a year for “launch capability”. Even if they do zero launches, US govt still gives them that."
Don’t know
"SpaceX commercial 🚀 launch market share went from 0% in 2010 to 65% in 2018. Despite massive subsidies to Boeing/Lockeed, they have never won a fair competition against SpaceX for several years. pic.twitter.com/sqAYCCcJtd"
"Exactly. That’s the critical point for Starship/BFR: more payload than the biggest rocket ever made, but for less money per launch than the smallest (orbital) rocket. Without something that lowers orbital flight cost by 100X, humanity will never be a multiplanet species."
"SpaceX Merlin architecture is simpler than staged combustion (eg SSME or RD), but it has world record for thrust/weight & thrust/cost engine. Raptor has better Isp, but I’m worried it may fall short on those two critical metrics."
So true 🤡 John Clarke 👌
"Not true. Limiting factor in any staged combustion rocket engine, liquid/gas or gas/gas, is pressure & temperature in oxygen preburner"
Whoever owns the early BTC deserves a Nobel prize in delayed gratification
"That said, I still only own 0.25 BTC, which a friend sent me several years ago. Don’t have any crypto holdings."
"I have been chief engineer/designer at SpaceX from day 1. Had I been better, our first 3 launches might have succeeded, but I learned from those mistakes. https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/07/as-the-spacex-steamroller-surges-european-rocket-industry-vows-to-resist/3/ …"
"Meant to say annualized production rate at end of 2019 probably around 500k, ie 10k cars/week. Deliveries for year still estimated to be about 400k."

"Also, Tesla was competing for some of same people as OpenAI & I didn’t agree with some of what OpenAI team wanted to do. Add that all up & it was just better to part ways on good terms."

On my bedside table
A biography on Korolev has center place in my study
"Just planning on keeping the public informed about progress & setbacks. Will be some RUDs along the way, but excitement is guaranteed!"
The goodwill of the public is critical to Starship’s success
At least 10X cheaper
"Very dependent on volume, but I’m confident moving to Mars (return ticket is free) will one day cost less than $500k & maybe even below $100k. Low enough that most people in advanced economies could sell their home on Earth & move to Mars if they want."
Yes
"This will sound implausible, but I think there’s a path to build Starship / Super Heavy for less than Falcon 9"
Close
"But not an extendable nozzle though, as that just saves length. Nozzle diameter is limited by body diameter."
Much above 300 bar main chamber pressure means extreme oxygen preburner pressure of 700 to 800+ bar. Definitely pushing the limit of known physics.
"Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 & O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy."
"Yes, aiming for 380 sec Isp with vac nozzle. Maybe 382 if we get lucky."
I think 6 where we lit main chamber & several with only preburners
About 11 secs
Definitely! It’s amazing that the RD-170 & RD-180 engines held the record for so many decades. Excellent engineering.
"Raptor reached 268.9 bar today, exceeding prior record held by the awesome Russian RD-180. Great work by @SpaceX engine/test team! pic.twitter.com/yPrvO0JhyY"

"Booster center of mass is much lower & more consistent (no payload mass to consider), so still biases towards engine first entry"
"Technically, the steel is radiatively cooled (not uncooled). T^4 is one of the most interesting things about reality!"
"Rocket booster temperatures won’t go much above 600 Kelvin on hottest parts of main body & maybe around 1200K on base, which uncooled steel can handle. Starship is around 1700K for a Mach 25 entry, so needs shielding of some kind."
Prob wise for version 1 to have legs or we will frag a lot of launch pads
"Welded, internal, longitudinal hat stringers. To the degree it may need hoop stiffness (prob not), combine with slosh baffles."
"The Super Heavy booster is only needed on Earth, so think of this as just “Starship” & sometimes it needs a boost, hence Super Heavy"
🔥🖤 SpaceX Engineering 🖤🔥

Sentry Mode (and Dog Mode) roll out next week

"Well, my past mistakes do seem extremely dumb, especially the ones where I mistakenly thought I was smart"
"Rocket mass ratio is about the same for aluminum-lithium vs 301 stainless full hard at cryo, but latter costs way less, is tougher & doesn’t even need paint!"
Still up to 31. Will probably fly with fewer initially in case it blows up.
Mostly true
"Cold gas thrusters only. Will use body flaps & main engines for landing orientation, so won’t need high thrust reaction control. Simplifies things considerably."
Yes
Initially making one 200 metric ton thrust engine common across ship & booster to reach the moon as fast as possible. Next versions will split to vacuum-optimized (380+ sec Isp) & sea-level thrust optimized (~250 ton).
Preparing to fire the Starship Raptor engine at @SpaceX Texas pic.twitter.com/8JCOi1BG6z
Yes. It’s very rare to find all three.
"To be clear, I’m confident that a stainless steel ship will be lighter than advanced aluminum or carbon fiber, because of strength to weight vs temperature & reduced need for heat shielding"
"Will probably make booster legs/flaps same as ship, instead of like F9"
"Yes, ship needs pitch/roll/yaw control across wide Mach regime & angle of attack"
Absolutely. You’ve touched on a very important point. The ship must be easy to repair on the moon and Mars.

"~1750K is peak heating expected on about 20% of Starship for LEO entry, ~1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel."

Ok
Tesla team did a great job!
2020
Yes
I will provide a detailed explanation in March/April
Time. Although it also turned out to be dramatically better.
Exactly
Yes
Probability at 60% & rising rapidly due to new architecture
30%
Congratulations
Coming soon
Yes
Got it 😀🇺🇦
"Definitely. All major highways in Texas will have Superchargers, all the way to Brownsville & across Mexico."
Yep
Yes
"Yes. Supercharger coverage will extend to 100% of Europe next year. From Ireland to Kiev, from Norway to Turkey. https://twitter.com/shortword/status/1078020855689547776 …"
"Most people don’t know that the Tesla Supercharger network allows easy long distance travel throughout USA, most of Europe, Canada and China https://www.tesla.com/findus?v=2&bounds=70.04727546592196%2C-72.3304073559143%2C-11.962870650187314%2C-138.2483761059143&zoom=3&filters=supercharger …"
We are dramatically increasing Tesla Superchargers within cities & working with landlords to add home charging to apartment buildings
Ok
Wow!
"This is incorrect. Vast majority of vehicle motion is returned to the battery, as the electric motors act like a generator in reverse. Brake pads on a Tesla literally never need to be replaced for lifetime of the car."
"Most importantly, every electric car, Tesla or otherwise, matters to the environment we all share. Every time someone chooses electric, the future gets a little bit brighter!

If not Tesla, please take a look at these other options:
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_electric_cars_currently_available …"
"And, because electricity costs much less than gasoline, a Model 3 can cost about $1000 less per year to operate. Because it’s electric, there are no oil changes, smog checks, tuneups, fuel filter, or brake pad replacements."
"There are also many state & local incentives, for example California offers $2500, plus $800 from utilities & access to carpool lane, Colorado $4000, etc https://www.tesla.com/support/incentives …"
Reminder to US buyers that the $7500 tax credit cuts in half in 5 days! Order online at  http://Tesla.com  to see if there is any inventory left in your region or visit Tesla stores.
"Merry Christmas & goodwill to all!!

"No, Raptors must be shielded during atmospheric entry. Although, maybe not ..."
"Thanks, hope you have a good holiday! Your insight on autonomy is excellent."
Sigh
Yes
"Leeward side needs nothing, windward side will be activity cooled with residual (cryo) liquid methane, so will appear liquid silver even on hot side"
Glad you’re ok!
Starship will look like liquid silver
Haha 🤣
Maybe
Much less
Skin will get too hot for paint. Stainless mirror finish. Maximum relfectivity.

Yes! People are almost always surprised to learn that Earth’s gravitational reach is infinite. “Zero gravity” is achieved by zooming around Earth super fast until outward acceleration equals inward acceleration of gravity.

Engineering is true magic
Yezzz
How bizarre. Sorry to hear that.
Putting in little outward-facing speakers would open up a lot of opportunities …
Please put “invented car fart” on my gravestone. This is my only request.
Our superalloy foundry is now almost fully operational. This allows rapid iteration on Raptor.
"SpaceX metallurgy team developed SX500 superalloy for 12000 psi, hot oxygen-rich gas. It was hard. Almost any metal turns into a flare in those conditions."
Thanks!
"It’s embarrassing that Boeing/Lockheed need to use a Russian engine on Atlas, but that engine design is brilliant"
"You def don’t want electric pumps on a rocket engine! Raptor turbopumps alone need 100,000 horsepower per engine. That’s not a typo."
"Yes, full flow, gas-gas, staged combustion. Will take us time to work up to 300 bar. That is a mad level."
Yes. Radically redesigned Raptor ready to fire next month.
"Seriously! We are just on the wrong planet for SSTO. Mars, no problem."
"Starlink V1 on Falcon, V2+ on Starship. Basically, all future products will contain either the word “star” or “link” 😀"
"Yes, but single stage to orbit with no payload is pointless. Add Super Heavy rocket booster & orbital payload is gigantic. Only need booster on Earth, due to deep gravity well & thick atmosphere. Starship alone on moons & Mars."
Coldformed at cryo
"This test hopper is at full body diameter of 9m / 30 ft, just not full height. Super Heavy will be full height & diameter."
We’re building subsections of the Starship Mk I orbital design there
Exactly
"For sheet/plate, at supplier made to our spec. For cast, in our Hawthorne foundry."
Yes
"I will do a full technical presentation of Starship after the test vehicle we’re building in Texas flies, so hopefully March/April"
"Yup. Actually, the only significant design element in common with early Atlas is stainless steel & we’re using a different alloy mix. I super ♥️ 300 Series Stainless!"
"While there are some material similarities, Starship is very different from the Atlas design"
"Stainless steel is correct, but different mixture of alloys & new architecture. Unlike Atlas, Starship is buckling stable on launchpad even when unpressurized."
"If Tesla committed delivery & customer made good faith efforts to receive before year end, Tesla will cover the tax credit difference"
Coming soon
"It will be tight, but Tesla production should have all mid-range Model 3 orders delivered by year end"
Try connecting to WiFi
"Tesla has released all cars for sale where original customer can’t take delivery before year end, as well as test drive / display cars, which cost less.

Reminder to US buyers that $7500 tax credit drops in half in 8 days. Order online at  http://Tesla.com  or visit stores."

"Perhaps lost in the transport debate is that @boringcompany built a 6000 ft tunnel in LA for ~$10M with V1 (Godot). Next tunnel will be made with V2 (Line-Storm). V3 (Prufrock), aspirationally 10X better, should be operational next year. For reference: https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2018/01/why-its-so-expensive-to-build-urban-rail-in-the-us/551408/ …"
Join our underground movement!
"Reverse back down (using same roller guide wheels, so no skill required) & tow or flatbed it out"
Ok 😀💨
Autopilot doesn’t need the guide wheels. They’re only there if there is a complete system failure. Turns will definitely be banked in future.
Are tunnels safe in an earthquake? pic.twitter.com/vxcZ2Hi2qx
Exactly
"The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber & a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume."
"Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees."
"Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp & elevator. Latter only for tight spaces."
"Passive lateral safety is required by regulators & I think they’re right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument."
"You’re right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn’t include it. We’re working on one that makes things clear."
"Pop up, park and walk!"
I know that area well. Best would be to add ramps into the tunnel system from the basement levels of the parking lots surrounding 3rd St.
"If all vehicles were densely seated buses, throughput in excess of 100,000 people per hour per lane is possible, but better to offer a range of vehicles & let people decide what makes them happy"
"A variety of vehicles, like normal roads, from a small car to a densely seated bus. Must be seated & belted for high speed safety."
Next step for @BoringCompany Loop is demonstrating high throughput at high speed. Target is 4000 vehicles/hour at 155mph (250km/h).
Precisely
Presentation starting at 8:15
"This *is* affordable mass transit, but better in that it takes you where and when you to go"
"The demo ride takes you in *same* car on road, down elevator, zips through tunnel using guide wheels, up elevator at destination & then drives on normal roads back to start"
"Actually way more capacity, way faster & way more convenient. Subways are fine, but it’s time to upgrade to something better."
All Boring Loops will include continuously circulating cars dedicated to pedestrians & cyclists
"Capable of traveling safely at over 150mph. At that speed, it will feel like teleporting within a city."
Yes
"This can be applied to any autonomous, electric vehicle, not just Tesla"

This part is true. I was trying to explain that we don’t want our cars to have a “tinny” sound. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-gwXJsWHupg …
You should def have a loaner. Will take care of it.
Seems likely that we’ll be able to reuse fairings that soft-landed in the ocean. May not need net at all. Would still love to see the catch happen though ⚾️ 👍
"Incorrect. “Chairman” is an honorific, not executive role, which means it’s not needed to run Tesla. Will retire that title at Tesla in 3 years. 60 Mins edited out end of my sentence, where I said I could do whatever I want. They cut “provided I have the support of shareholders”."
About 10 to 14 days
"Also, Tesla policy is that if you order a car without a test drive you get 3 days to return for full refund vs 1 day if you do get a test drive (resources are overbooked)"
"Important note for US Tesla buyers: Federal tax credit drops by $3750 in 3 weeks.

To be on the cancellation waitlist for delivery this year or if you want a display car, order at  http://Tesla.com  or visit our stores. Full refund if Tesla can’t deliver your car this year."
No need to wait. It’s super easy to swap the HW2 and HW3 computers. Sensors are the same.
I’m dying to make a pickup truck so bad … we might have a prototype to unveil next year
Yes
"Love that people are buying a Tesla for the product itself, even if they don’t believe in climate change.

Not everyone can be convinced about global warming, but if an electric car is simply the best product, they don’t need to be. https://twitter.com/InsideEVs/status/1072485984628105219 …"
Probably next month
You’re right. There was a ton of footage with many people at Tesla that would be great to share. Longer pieces like we did with @MKBHD tell a more interesting story.
"We’re opening a lot of Tesla service centers next year, including Knoxville. Tesla will post upcoming city opening map this week."
Probably end of next year
So true 🦙💩✨😴
This is a very misleading edit. Please post the full transcript where I complete the sentence.
"60 Mins actually had several hours of interview time, which they distilled to 14 mins. Many stories could been told with that time. This was accurate as viewed from an Upper East Side Manhattan dinner party."
We are awaiting EU regulatory approval for this release
"Full self-driving option is required with the Tesla designed hardware 3 computer. This is a simple plug in replacement for the NVidia computer, but has over 10X the image processing ability."
"Already testing traffic lights, stop signs & roundabouts in development software. Your Tesla will soon be able to go from your garage at home to parking at work with no driver input at all."
"If you have a Tesla built in past 2 years, definitely try Navigate on Autopilot. It will blow your mind. Automatically passes slow cars & takes highway interchanges & off-ramps."
Machete!!
"It was supposed to be, but that was a dumb decision. In the end, Roadster only had 7% of parts in common with the Lotus Elise or any other car."
"Major credit to AC Propulsion for the tzero electric sports car 1997-2003 that inspired Tesla Roadster. Without that, Tesla wouldn’t exist or would have started much later. pic.twitter.com/NxCgYO9JXx"
"Yeah, we wanted to name our company after Tesla, the great scientist/engineer, but use of the Tesla name in automotive was already trademarked in the US, Europe & later China."
"Buying  http://Tesla.com  took over a decade, $11M & amazing amount of effort. Didn’t like  http://teslamotors.com  even when we were only making 🚘."
"Tesla history trivia: we didn’t actually come up with the Tesla Motors name. Bought trademark off Brad Siewert for $75k in late 2004. He’d originally filed for it in 1994. Our alternative name was Faraday, which was used by a competitor several years later. https://twitter.com/60Minutes/status/1071174335778447361 …"
"Both, but demo Starship is being built now, whereas Super Heavy hardware will start getting built in spring"
But cool pics of the demo Starship that will fly suborbital hops coming in ~4 weeks
Yes
Interesting
"Fairly heavy metal, but extremely strong"
The new design is metal
"As far as we know, it’s the largest single piece titanium casting in the world. Major improvement over the old aluminum grid fins, as the titanium doesn’t need heat shielding or even paint."
Boring Company product launch on Dec 18. More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars & ground to tunnel car elevators.

"Exactly. Default Autopilot behavior, if there’s no driver input, is to slow gradually to a stop & turn on hazard lights. Tesla service then contacts the owner. Looking into what happened here."
It is so hard to move in armor!

Ok
Good advice
Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. We’re also working on vision-only driving.
Glad you’re ok
"Perhaps most telling is that Norway, which is partly above the Arctic Circle, has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth."
"As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly 10% range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic."
"Incoming rocket & fairing probably visible, but landing itself is over the horizon"

Good idea
Coming soon
Shifting resources from sales to service for next several days
Should be next week
"No, it’s the first or boost stage, analogous to, but much larger than Falcon 9"
Later versions will
"Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceship/upper stage & Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earth’s deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons)"
Renaming BFR to Starship
"No, we’re just going to accelerate BFR"
Yes
"Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster"
Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets.
"No, it’s got enough load capacity & volume to carry the battery pack & our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort, all things considered."
"In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts & processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast"
"What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output."
"Lot on our plate, so it’s either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler & produce sooner or do all & produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster."
Ok
Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. That’s a great van. We will inquire.
Absolutely agree
Investigating
Probably mid 2019
Tesla can provide heating/cooling/lights/music for days using battery
"Not everywhere, but should be possible around major metros. Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed. Lmk if not."
Should be possible. Please ask service & lmk response.
"No, but perhaps in a few years"
"Yeah, good idea. We have that state internally, so can push data to phone app."
"Haha, just like Super Troopers"
Ideal situation in breakdown/accident (assuming no injuries) is that Tesla arrives at scene fast with top-of-the-line service loaner

"Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive."
It will alert Tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level

Yes
"Will also be using dedicated roll-on, roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to Europe & Asia in Q1. Major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. Did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently."
We bought some trucking companies & secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter
Probably technically able to do so in about a year. Then up to regulators.
"Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, it’s better to use trucks. Single load/unload & direct to owner location."

"We know we’ll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel & have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now & avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong & oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far … https://twitter.com/NewsHour/status/1026599623396192256 …"
Because people on the ground know more about what’s actually needed than politicians do
"Good, but not hospital grade. S & X were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. Requires a giant filter with separate acid & alkaline gas neutralization layers. Not enough room in Model 3."

"No, we’re building a BFR dev ship to do supersonic through landing tests in Boca Chica, Texas"
Won’t land propulsively for those reasons. Ultra light heat shield & high Mach control surfaces are what we can’t test well without orbital entry. I think we have a handle on propulsive landings.

"To clarify further, the long-term goal for Tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible."
"Tesla will manufacture all battery modules & packs at China Giga, as we do today in California & Nevada. Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner."

"Get this question a lot, so need to clarify that there’s no such thing as a Tesla “refresh”. Other car companies do this every ~3 years, but Tesla constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every week."
"To simplify production, many Tesla Model S & X interior configs, will no longer be available after Nov 1. Order now to be sure of the one you want."

Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year

The FSD upgrade is the Tesla computer with our NN chip
I believe it’s $5k
~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
Somewhere between 500% & 2000%
"To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU & better use of discrete GPU."
"This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude."

The CIO of a major pension fund is the one who deserves credit for uncovering this scam
"The big funds can & will, as they’re suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for “passive” index tracking."
"Debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively & consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market & without clear consent of the shareholder"
"Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors & retirement funds, don’t realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return."
"There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base & gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators"
I hope to be less wrong over time
You’re most welcome. Hope to do more to help in the future.

"Consider an ice skater. Same weight, but spins/turns much faster with arms in vs arms out. Same principle is true for a car."
"Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have 50% on front, 50% on rear & still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good."
Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia & other important car terms at  https://www.complex.com/sports/2013/03/25-car-terms-you-need-to-know/polar-moment-of-inertia …
"Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling & driving feel. Extremely important metric."
A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car
"Yes, when it comes to physics, make sure Newton is on your side"
"Helps improve forward crumple zone length, especially important in high speed frontal impacts, and moments of inertia in side impacts"
Tesla piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details
"Exactly, all 5 star are *not* the same, as the videos show. “5 star” just means a car met a certain threshold, but injury probability stats (real numbers) tell you by how much."

Def no forced sales. Hope all shareholders remain. Will be way smoother & less disruptive as a private company. Ends negative propaganda from shorts.
"Yes, but liquidity events would be limited to every 6 months or so (like SpaceX)"
No change
Shareholders could either to sell at 420 or hold shares & go private
Absolutely. Am super appreciative of Tesla shareholders. Will ensure their prosperity in any scenario.
My hope is *all* current investors remain with Tesla even if we’re private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelity’s SpaceX investment.
Yes
I don’t have a controlling vote now & wouldn’t expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I won’t be selling in either scenario.

Makes a lot of sense
This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option & worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now it’s there for anyone who needs it in future. Something’s messed up if this is not a good thing.

That would be cool. I wonder what it’s like under all that ice.
A second one that is 30cm shorter is almost complete
Yes. Those videos are from this morning.
"According to divers who have made the passage, yes. However, we also made an exact replica that is inflatable, so that the entire path can be tested without risk of blockage."

"Thanks, but we’ve not done anything useful yet. It is all other people."
"According to divers who have made the journey, this is capable of maneuvering through all passages"
Tube diameter is 31cm
"Mini-sub arriving in about 17 hours. Hopefully useful. If not, perhaps it will be in a future situation."
Thanks @palicharterhigh for letting us use your pool
It is an honor to work with them
"With some mods, this could also work as an escape pod in space"

I want to know who is running the Etherium scambots! Mad skillz …
It is both alarming & explanatory that you run a psych ward
"Diver weight belts wrapped around outside. Mini-sub only weighs ~40kg dry, so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave, then add weight belts for wet sections."
"Yeah, that sounds cool. Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio & phone/music player."
"Aluminum shell has high thermal conductivity, so will be close to ambient. If ambient is cold, a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant warm."

Buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of capsule. They’re prevented from sliding off by the 6 diver handhold attachments.
"Testing for 3 more hours in LA, then it’s on a plane to Thailand"
"Design based on dive team feedback (primarily Stanton): 4 air / oxygen ports front & rear, front ports protected by nosecone. Dual O-ring seal on acrylic rear plate with clear view of occupant head. Leak/buckling proof to 10X cave water pressure."
I am an engineer
Tight control code is always C
Python is done right. Great name story too.
"If I am a narcissist (which might be true), at least I am a useful one"
🖤🖤🖤 Python 🖤🖤🖤
Pretty close. There is a nosecone on the front to protect against rocks impacting fwd air hoses with a hole on the side for hoses to exit.
Turbo
C
"Given Chiang Rai airport hours, soonest we could’ve departed US was an hour ago, but cave now closed for diver rescue. Will continue testing in LA in case needed later or for somewhere else in future."
"Will do. Even if not useful here, perhaps it will be in a future situation."
Extremely talented dive team. Makes sense given monsoon. Godspeed. https://twitter.com/bbcbreaking/status/1015811558851661825 …
Yes
Yes
Fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air. Segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights & adjust bouyancy.
Yes
"4 handles/hitch points on front & 4 on rear. 2 air tank connections on front & 2 on rear, allowing 1 to 4 tanks simultaneously connected, all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops."
I’m in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub
"Construction complete in about 8 hours, then 17 hour flight to Thailand"
"Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience & tenacity of kids & diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best."
"Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust."
Ground winds would
Yes. All-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. It’s a beast.
Can’t be too buoyant
"Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does."
Good idea
"Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod & vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary & less susceptible to panic attack."
You’re welcome. Happy birthday! 🎁🎉🎂
"Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about in that tweet — double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying."
Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube & rock wall.
It’s open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
"Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large."
I would def recommend this
Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks & front/rear rope tow hitch & lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
Interesting
"Great, thanks"
Inflatable tubes & pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand & is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
"So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out & water won’t come in"
"Does you know output voltage & amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed."
SpaceX & Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
"Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd & 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps & tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up & then transit."
"So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power."
Have a small velcro slit entrance & exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
"Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you’re in an air tube, time doesn’t matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections."
Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network & inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof & auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.
Exactly. A journalist who publicly expresses love for & parties in Vegas with a prominent shortseller of any given company should disclose this when writing articles.
"I know you & believe you, but it means Lopez misled readers in her article, because that is exactly what she said"
I didn’t ask anyone and the people who sent the snapshots don’t work for me. They just don’t like hypocrites.
They were sent to me by multiple people on the Internet. I don’t use Facebook.
Lopez wrote that Melissa Lee of CNBC was “dancing her face off” with Chanos in Vegas. Is this true? http://www.norwichbulletin.com/article/20140516/NEWS/305169979 …
Why did @lopezlinette publish a love letter puff piece about Chanos’s cuff links? Who took the pic? Obv not objective http://www.businessinsider.com/jim-chanos-sweet-chinese-yuan-cufflinks-2014-5 …
pic.twitter.com/ystkbF7p1W
.@Lopezlinette posted on social media that she was partying in Vegas with Chanos & Tepper with caption “Love both these dudes”. Doesn’t sound very objective http://www.dodgeglobe.com/article/20140516/News/305169981 …
"Norwegians are right to be upset with Tesla. We are having trouble expanding our service facilities in Oslo especially. Can solve quickly with Tesla mobile service vans, but awaiting govt permission to do so."
Are you 100% certain that @businessinsider stands by @lopezlinette & supports everything she’s done? Why won’t Lopez go on record saying that she never offered Tripp anything for inside info or asked him to break his confidentiality agreement by taking detailed video of Tesla IP?
Sounds fishy. How did that go down?
TRUE
"So @lopezlinette publicly stated she stans for Chanos, Tesla’s most prominent short-seller. In her words, he is “one of the greatest.” Her articles print Chanos’s view verbatim. This is not journalism."
".@lopezlinette You stated publicly that you “see eye to eye” with Chanos, the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla?"
What a coincidence …
Am not attacking all media or even all of @CNBC. Just asked if you inform public about an analyst’s prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your show.
"Indeed, very simple question. To be specific: @lopezlinette, did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue?"
"Exactly. @cnbc, I just asked a simple question. Please answer."
"Strange. @cnbc, is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings & extremely bad prediction records? Are your viewers informed about an analyst’s track record before hearing their opinion."
"Note, no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself. https://twitter.com/tesla/status/1014515503740567553 …"
"Sounds very sketchy if true. @lopezlinette, is it possible you’re  serving as an inside trading source for one of Tesla’s biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him & he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange. Is this true?"
"@lopezlinette has published several false articles about Tesla, including a doozy where she claimed Tesla scrapped more batteries than our total S,X &3 production number, which is physically impossible."
"Wow, so @sal19 of @Reuters wrote article that misled public about Model 3 production & followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. Nice work @sal19 & @Reuters."
".@Reuters, why did you mislead the people public about this number?"
".@Reuters is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by 800 cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie 1,900/week. Tesla built 1,913 S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target."
Happy to support
"Boring Co has advanced ground penetrating radar & is pretty good at digging holes. Don’t know if pump rate is limited by electric power or pumps are too smal. If so, could dropship fully charged Powerpacks and pumps."
Belfast is beautiful

We must aspire to truth
Important to read the Wash Post article. The “unable to account for” number does not refer to actual lost children. It refers to calls not answered or returned in a 30 day period.
Hopefully in V9.0 release in a few months
TRUE
"We should always be concerned about the welfare of children & those who cannot protect themselves, wherever they may be, but it seems much of the reporting on this issue has been partisan & often inaccurate"
"“… of the 7,635 children, 6,075 remained where they were placed, 52 had moved, 28 had run away and five were deported. That left 1,475 migrant children. Just because their parents or guardians did not return HHS’s phone calls after 30 days does not mean the children are missing”"
"“All 7,635 children were resettled by HHS. After 30 days, the department called the parents or guardians to check up on things. But these calls were not required by law, and in 1,475 cases, the parents or guardians did not respond”"

Not sure we actually need a building. This tent is pretty sweet. Tesla Grohmann line is in place at Giga & spooling up now. They super kicked ass too. Heiliger Strohsack!

Well said https://m.dailykos.com/stories/2018/5/29/1767826/-The-War-on-Tesla-Musk-and-the-Fight-for-the-Future …
Then you’ll be fine
Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter & simpler than most.
"...which clearly doesn’t work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of what’s happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so they’re getting desperate."
"Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread."
More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
How big is your short position? Just curious.
Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda & hand them to me. This one guy’s claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.
"I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest & failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right."
"UAW doesn’t have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can’t even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they’re getting paid trolls & far left shills to trash Tesla & me in press & social media. Such creeps."
"I’m not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can’t compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don’t want Tesla to die too."
"I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people."
"Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon, as people said I was high if though it could work, so I named it after their insult."
"Iain certainly wasn’t pro-union in the Culture books. At all. And wouldn’t be in the case of Tesla. Banks was about freedom through & through. Maybe for a single buyer (monopsony) vs single seller (monopoly), I would be too, but that’s a special case."

"Trade is just that Roadster becomes a 2 seater instead of a 2+2. COPV in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons"
"Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. It’s what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust — literally bulletproof."
Not recommended for urban environments

"The actual amount of time I spend on Twitter is tiny. My tweets are literally what I’m thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda."
It is amazingly hard to find a simple solution. A complicated one is relatively easy.

Add an R for Roadster 👽💕🚀
"Sigh. This is crux of matter: can’t make system too annoying or people won’t use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can’t allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially."
A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady.
"Yes. Hopefully, I’m not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing."
Will do
"Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but there’s no escaping Newton’s Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) & O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha."
"You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we don’t think there will be another."
"Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time."
"Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the “halo crown” effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric."
"That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now & fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9. To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features."
"This is why I’m not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked, then I’d know everything’s fine & no need for a media credibility rating system like Pravduh 🤔"
"Zip2 also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional & city papers online for the first time, and made major functionality advancements to the NY Times, Boston Globe & Knight-Ridder websites. NYT, KR & Hearst were all major investors in Zip2."
20 years of intense programming on extremely weak CPUs with nothing for memory & a straw for bandwidth tends to burn itself onto your 🧠 like a branding iron. Can still remember trying to squeeze fractions of a millisecond out of the /?€}%$& fetch_joystick_state function.
"In early 90s, I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU & CD-ROM to act in parallel, so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly. Required C++, assembly & direct flipping of CPU registers. That company’s name was Rocket Science. Fate loves irony."
"That’s quite a blast from the past! After my Zip2 experience w patents, I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation, instead of fostering it. I aspired to file zero patents after that. In 2014, we open-sourced all Tesla patents https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you …"
"At Zip2, I wrote entire V1 of software for drawing vector maps & calculating point to point directions anywhere in US (first ever company to do so), as well as white pages & business listings w reviews (an early Yelp). Also wrote V1 of classifieds, autotrading & real estate apps."
"More background: I arrived in North America at 17 w $2000, a backpack & a suitcase full of books. Paid my own way thru college. Dropped out of Stanford Eng/Phys grad school w $110k in college debt. Created Internet startup w bro & Greg Khouri (love bro & loved Greg, may he RIP)"
"We don’t think our product will be the cause of any wildfires, but The Boring Company is donating $10k."
"Using the config you describe, plus an electric pump to replenish air in COPV, when car power draw drops below max pack power output, makes sense. But we are going to go a lot further."
"19 years ago, when my 1st company got bought, I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 (best car ever imo). Was no contest. I bought F1 & a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way…"
"SpaceX option package for new Tesla Roadster will include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around car. These rocket engines dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking & cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly …"

You’re most welcome. More to come in this regard.
"Tesla will always refute articles that are misleading & point out if there is someone with a pattern of doing so. Many fit this description, but Consumer Reports is always fair & accurate in their criticism."
"Ride comfort & aero/road noise already better than CR car, which was early production. Wish we could make the car perfect from day 1, but there’s always room for improvement. Highly recommend dropping tire pressure 10% below max to ~39 psi for comfort. Only affects range by ~2%."
Prob 8.3
Yes
"All items below will go to all Model 3s within next few months with V8.2 software. To report a bug or ask for a feature, press voice button, say “bug report” followed by issue description. https://twitter.com/mactechgenius/status/1001867688413544448 …"
“Pneumatic” means propelled by air. Opposite of Hyperloop.
"Braking & UI upgrades apply to all Model 3s. Improved windshield for aero noise & suspension for ride comfort are major ops. Unless you’re really bothered by them, don’t replace. Best way to improve ride is drop tire pressure to ~39 psi. 45 psi is best range, but lower comfort."
"Yeah, absolutely"
Really appreciate the high quality critical feedback from @ConsumerReports. Road noise & ride comfort already addressed too. UI improvements coming via remote software update later this month. https://twitter.com/timkhiggins/status/1001860891317387264 …

This is the new production line for battery module Zone 4. Will play a key role in getting from 3000/week to 6000/week for Model 3.
I have never attacked science. Definitely attacked misleading journalism like yours though.
"Pravda was incorporated a year ago. Also, Tesla factory safety has improved every year & is now better than industry avg. Misleading articles refer to Tesla being worse than avg in 2015 when we were just figuring things out."
Worth a shot
Of course! (Prav)Duh. It is named after the most pernicious propaganda machine in history specifically to highlight what we want to avoid. It’s called “satire” …
"This is going to help journalism, not harm it. Please be so kind as to hold your fire until you actually see it."
"Problem solved, was able to buy  http://Pravduh.com ! Game on …"
"I know, I know. Russia seriously didn’t correct me on this!"
"Something needs to be done to reward consistent, high quality journalism. Some in media are absurdly indignant before even seeing the product. Odd …"
"Turns out  http://Pravda.com  is actually owned by Ukraine. For some reason, Russia didn’t bother to correct me …"
"For some reason, Russia didn’t bother to correct me …"
"Tried to buy  http://Pravda.com , but Russia said no. Turns out they already use it."
"Definitely did not. I’ve been through many press cycles & know full well same person praising me today will trash me tomorrow. Journos hound me constantly for interviews, but I do almost none these days. ♥️ Twitter as it allows me to bypass journo bs."
I’ve just had it with sanctimonious journalists who appoint themselves protectors of the public interest & yet believe that same public is too stupid & immoral to assess their credibility. It’s amazing that you don’t understand how insufferably hypocritical that is. Wow.
The Tesla facility is open plan & we’re not going to erect walls everywhere for a journo tour. I know journalists too well & they are some of the worst & best human beings I’ve ever met. You’re the former.
No
Nano applies to everything & therefore means nothing. Definitely indicates bs. Sorry.  http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Nanotechnology …
"Yes, because Tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world & products that haven’t been unveiled yet. You don’t have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product launches."
"Wow, you’re ignorant. Don’t remember you, but disclosing classified US missile technology to hostile nations would violate ITAR law & land you in jail. I didn’t review it, but my team did. Obviously nobody cared about what your article said. Please."
Done
Have a confirmed real name identity section & an unconfirmed identity section. Latter with subscore that excludes probable botnets.
Be careful what you wish for https://m.imdb.com/title/tt3333824/ …
"Amazingly, the “media is awesome” vote is declining, despite hundreds of articles attacking this very poll🤔"
My point exactly https://twitter.com/rockypruitt/status/999535383049273344 …
"Ahem, you have “nano” in your bio. That is 100% synonymous with bs."
Reddit is great
"Come on media, you can do it! Get more people to vote for you. You are literally the media."
Exactly. The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They don’t realize how little credibility they actually have with the public.
"Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others, ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt."
I did to any who asked
"That was obvious from a mile away. I tried to use their product & it didn’t work. Not exactly a genius move by WSJ, but they were brave enough to say it."
"Maybe after you get your Model 3, we can talk about what you like & what needs to be improved"
"But consider it real. We could unveil Model Y anytime from late this year to mid next year, so March 15 is about right."
"I just made that up, because the Ides of March sounded good"
Gasoline or diesel?
What car do you drive?
March 15
The media
"Hi Kara! I’m open to it. Right now, I’m cranking super hard at the Tesla factory, so it depends on how things are going next week."
"Maybe the media credibility rating site should be called “You’re Right!”  I do actually own  http://youreright.com , but for the moment I just have it automatically forward to Facebook News."
Definitely
"There no good car emojis. I mean seriously, what the heck are these 🚗 🚙 and this is the best one 🚘"
Yo
That’s the basic idea
"For some reason, this is the best I’ve felt in a while. Hope you’re feeling good too 🚀♥️🌏"
"I just tried to donate, but you don’t accept PayPal. Lmk when you do."
"Um, you just tweeted about this, so obv you do"
Thank you! I thought it was so obvious …
Exactly. UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.
"Yeah, I think you do great work"
"If you’re in media & don’t want Pravda to exist, write an article telling your readers to vote against it …"
🤗
"I’ve never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived & gave people back their jobs. They haven’t forgotten UAW betrayed them. That’s why UAW can’t even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote."
Of course
"It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla & millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. We are not perfect, but we’re doing our best to make clean energy real & be a good company."
"No, they’re just some rich kids in Berkeley who took their political science prof too seriously"
Will do
Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)
That’s why editors are included too
We don’t. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.
"Even if some of the public doesn’t care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors & publications will. It is how they define themselves."
Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.
Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join
"Not only needs to be botproof, but seek & unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army"
Exactly
"Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article & track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor & publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda …"
An exception that proves the rule
"Uh, this is Twitter. How many characters do you want?"
"Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks & earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn’t advertise, but fossil fuel companies & gas/diesel car companies are among world’s biggest advertisers."
The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.
Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he’s above criticism. Try being truthful & the public will believe you again.
"Thought you’d say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks “You’re just like Trump!” Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago."
"The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them https://twitter.com/electrekco/status/999318852365303808 …"
"This will sound super obvious, but Genesis & Oblivion"
I am not cool
The one about to come out called So Heavy i fell through the earth
"Was sad to see G getting tons of undeserved flak because of me, so I’m glad there’s some good too ♥️🎼🐇. Her music is incredible."
Thanks. Not super fun right now 😔
Busted 👻
"None of those criteria are certain by themselves, but when taken together & messages have an obv agenda, it almost always indicates use of a network of self-validating troll accounts"
"Troll dead giveaways: not using real names, obv fake pics & backgrounds, low follower/follow ratio, account recently created, repeating same phrases, etc (sigh)"
Great idea!
Will do it later this year. Too much on plate right now. Will be available as an upgrade from service.
Love original Deus Ex! That would be awesome.
Interesting he stops at ‘09. That’s when you drove GM & Chrysler into bankruptcy & lost tens of thousands of jobs for people that counted on you.
Just order your car with the James Bond option package. It’s an off-menu item for those in the know 😉
"But ya know what, let’s test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back, even tho UAW betrayed us 8 years ago & left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is 1/2 what it was with them & wages were lower. Maybe. Let’s hold a vote & find out."
"In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM & Chrysler to bankruptcy & lost 200,000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over & now it has 10k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry & everyone knows it."
"We’re going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X & 3. What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?"
Good point
"No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness & enforcement of 2 class “lords & commoners” system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a 2 class system! Managers & workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much."
"More “Reveal” bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, & they’ve never found us to misrepresent. On other hand, Ford, Chrysler & GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article …"
No problem
"They are incorrect. We never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet."
"Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!"
I didn’t meet with him
I definitely don’t do this 5 minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Can’t be creative otherwise.
Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
"Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn’t fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars."
"Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced."
"To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today’s Model S is far more refined than initial production."
ABS calibration algorithm
"Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise & many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production."
"Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won’t stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car."
"Stop, you’re making me blush ☺️"
"Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little"
Complexity is the devil. Words can’t express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp & trying to get to profitability. But we’ll try.
"Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations."
"The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3’s have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we’ve seen anything like this."
"Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3’s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers"
"Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance & others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out & address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update."
"Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers & beeping forklifts you said didn’t exist. Please send your meeting request to wakassliar@tesla.com."
Gwynne’s awesome. Been SpaceX prez for 10 years. Super love working with her.
♥️🦄
"Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs."
Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW & everybody already gets healthcare.
"Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines & tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as “facts” by Reveal."
We’re working on allowing you to use your phone in car when you hear a rattle/squeak & pinpoint origin by acoustic signature & triangulation

For sure before snowfall this year
It can tow far more than rated capacity
Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round.
"With production, 1st you need achieve target rate & then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money & die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k/wk to ship $35k Tesla & live."
That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.
Exactly 🚀💫🎉! That will be really fun & shed light on what’s happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.
"Yeah, “Reveal” was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as today’s non-union."
"About 2% of Tesla, incl salaried & hourly, union & non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally & on social media & lied about it."
Yes
Exactly
They can form a union whenever they want & there’s nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just don’t want to.
Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. It’s like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.
"They are correct. It’s awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight."
"It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you can’t tell"
Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July.
"Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now."
Good idea ...
That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front & a motor in rear. One is optimized for power & one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination & don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec & top speed to 140 mph.
Black & white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
"Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks"
"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker & with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."
"Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3:
3.5 sec  0-60mph
155 mph Top Speed
310 mile Range"
"It’s only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing"
Exactly
Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself & zero paperwork.
I’m about to test the configurator & then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight
"You can tweet to Tesla, me and/or get something upvoted in message boards"
That is the way to go. Thanks for buying our cars!
"Also, carbon fiber spoiler, 20” Performance wheels, black & white interior."
"AC induction front & switched reluctance, partial permanent magnet rear. Silicon Carbide inverters in both. Performance drive units are lot sorted for highest sigma output & get double the burn-in."
Working on Model 3 dual motor all-wheel drive & performance versions. Driving feel is amazing. Aiming to release config late tonight.

"Time will tell, but so far it appears so"
"It certainly needs to be better & we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives & reduces injuries should be released."
What’s actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
"It’s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage  https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/tesla-with-autopilot-slams-into-truck-stopped-at-red-light/2018/05/12/18d2e740-563e-11e8-a6d4-ca1d035642ce_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.7466cb626644 …"
Yes
"According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It’s not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter."
"This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg."
Happy Mother’s Day Mom! Love you so much.
"Fair criticism, but we’re fixing it fast. Hackathon going on right now to fix 2 worst robot production chokepoints. Looks promising."

Good piece by Ars https://twitter.com/arstechnica/status/995457711398678529 …
Rate at which things are getting more bizarre appears to be increasing
"Exactly. Gasoline cars will be like steam engines — quaint, but not something you’d actually use to get around. Btw, I like steam engines & trains in general."
"Yeah, I heard this so many times. In the future, it will seem bizarre that we used to crash rockets into the ocean instead of reusing them."
Yo
Will make that a setting
"Fossil fuels subsidized at $10 million a minute, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/18/fossil-fuel-companies-getting-10m-a-minute-in-subsidies-says-imf …"
No use arguing with chimp. You’re blocked.
"That article was pushed as propaganda to counter IMF study showing fossil fuel subsidies to be $5 trillion/year. Even if $4.9B was true, combined market cap of Tesla & SpaceX is $80B. Where did the other $75B come from? Ass 🎩 …"

"AWD & white interior in July. Air suspension prob later. Note, that’s when we *start* making them. Can’t instantly fill all orders. Will take 6+ months to do so."
"Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla, which means Tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. Tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as EV incentives declined. How strange …"
"I love it too, but trying to keep config simple so as not to blow up the production ramp"
Tesla will enable orders end of next week for dual motor AWD & performance. Starting production of those in July. Air suspension prob next year.
A cool thing about the design is that’s easy to incorporate branch loops to serve small to mid size cities without slowing down the main loop at all
"Already started DC to NY route.
Hopefully start LA to SF next year. That will be true @Hyperloop w pressurized pods in near vacuum tunnels & faster than jetliner."

"This will work on entire S & X fleet, even first production units. Cool thing about software upgrades is that we can keep making your car better long after you bought it."
"All X & S will soon work with no key if your phone pairs w Bluetooth, signal strength is high & you enable feature"
"Yeah, we will add that as a feature"

Oh and uh short burn of the century comin soon. Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.

"True. And once they were on the call, I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them."
"We went through the same drama on S & X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom."
"Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising & no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0."
"The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter"
"The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors"
Exactly
"First, it’s important to know that Tesla is the most shorted (meaning most bet against) stock on the market & has been for a while https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/11/tesla-is-the-biggest-short-in-the-us-stock-market.html …"

"Yeah, news is actually super good. Model S & X are producing major positive cash flow & Model 3 is about to do same."
"To be clear, I’m a big fan of MKBHD, but this is an important clarification"
"The “dry” questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them."

Upgraded SpaceX/Tesla Hyperloop pod speed test soon. Will try to reach half speed of sound (and brake) within ~1.2km.
Model 3 is the whole point. We only made the more expensive cars in order to make the mass-market car. We lacked the economies of scale and expertise to make it until now.

We’ve never advertised with FB. None of my companies buy advertising or pay famous people to fake endorse. Product lives or dies on its own merits.
"Instagram’s probably ok imo, so long as it stays fairly independent. I don’t use FB & never have, so don’t think I’m some kind of martyr or my companies are taking a huge blow. Also, we don’t advertise or pay for endorsements, so … don’t care."

"To be clear, I think a fair outcome for all is quite likely. China has already shown a willingness to open their markets and I believe they will do the right thing."
"We raised this with the prior administration and nothing happened. Just want a fair outcome, ideally where tariffs/rules are equally moderate. Nothing more. Hope this does not seem unreasonable."
"I am against import duties in general, but the current rules make things very difficult. It’s like competing in an Olympic race wearing lead shoes."

Found the source of the problem. The NASA database has the Falcon Block 1 performance. Version currently in production and set to fly in a few months is Block 5. SpaceX GNC team is submitting updated numbers.
Not enough ignition fluid to light the outer two engines after several three engine relights. Fix is pretty obvious.
"East, to support high flight rates for F9 and dual ocean landings for FH side boosters"
No
A Shortfall of Gravitas
A third is under construction
"Under consideration. We’ve already stretched the upper stage once. Easiest part of the rocket to change. Fairing 2, flying soon, also has a slightly larger diameter. Could make fairing much longer if need be & will if BFR takes longer than expected."
"Side boosters landing on droneships & center expended is only ~10% performance penalty vs fully expended. Cost is only slightly higher than an expended F9, so around $95M."
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberth_effect …
Of course :)
"Maybe that plan works out, but I will seriously eat my hat with a side of mustard if that rocket flies a national security spacecraft before 2023"
"That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. Nutty high."
"Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not."
"The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy."

"However, public transit is obviously not fully solving the problem, as most major cities have been in traffic hell for decades with no solution in sight. Multi-level tunnels can solve this, but we need much better tunneling technology, as it is currently super slow and expensive."
"Major navigation overhaul coming in early 2018. Will be light-years ahead of current system, but we are testing it rigorously before rolling out."
"For the record, I actually love trains, most subways and London buses."
"Idiots can be very dangerous when they seem smart, but aren’t (having “PhD” in their bio is a dead giveaway), as some policymakers may get fooled. That’s what really bothered me about that human cat meme / transit “expert”."

Falcon Heavy launching from same @NASA pad as the Saturn V Apollo 11 moon rocket. It was 50% higher thrust with five F-1 engines at 7.5M lb-F. I love that rocket so much.
Max thrust at lift-off is 5.1 million pounds or 2300 metric tons. First mission will run at 92%.
Hate it when that happens. Some people are so rude!

Not good. Sounds like some 3rd party installers are taking advantage of Powerwall demand >> supply. Taking action …
The internal Tesla Powerwall install team in PR is very small right now. Sending experienced installers from continental US to hire & train local team as fast as possible.
"Tesla always charges the same price for a Powerwall (only taxes & shipping costs vary), so something is messed up here. I've asked my team to stop shipment to any installers charging excessive premiums."
"Sounds good, I look forward to talking later today"

This is about as true as TIME being a paragon of great journalism. Please spend at least 8 seconds checking your facts.
Just because I have the outfit and the awesome weapons doesn't make me a ninja. That requires years of training.
There are dozens of bogus or half-true anecdotes don't really matter & maybe 5 to 10 that do. Guess I could post for those interested.
"One other I'd like to correct from the biography: I never said I was a samurai. Said I was ninja. No, that's a joke. Didn't say that either."
"MB was given 52 weeks of salary & stock in appreciation for her great contribution & left to join a small firm, once again as a generalist"
"Mary Beth was an amazing assistant for over 10 yrs, but as company complexity grew, the role required several specialists vs one generalist"
"Of all the bogus anecdotes, this one troubles me the most. Ashlee never actually ran this story by me or my assistant. It is total nonsense."
"Ashlee Vance's biography is mostly correct, but also rife with errors & never independently fact-checked, despite my request that he do so"

All Model S and X cars will have an auto raise and lower function for the steering wheel in a few months.
I spoke directly with The President three weeks ago about Paris. Many others have too. Cautiously optimistic of a positive decision.
Interesting idea. Would give a dynamic 360 deg surround view as you're driving. Have this in dev mode. Can be a bit distracting though.
"Early next year. To start with, we're making the simplest Model 3 first, like we did with S. Didn't do it with X, because I was an idiot."
We could add that function pretty easily from a technical standpoint. Just need to add in the billing software.
"Can be set higher than that for highways, but limited to +5mph or +8km/h off highway (true avg drive speed) for pedestrian & cyclist safety"
Exactly
Still on for end of year. Just software limited. Any Tesla car with HW2 (all cars built since Oct last year) will be able to do this.
There's just no way. Hundreds of parts and most of wiring harness would have to be replaced. Would cost more to retrofit than trading in.
HW2. HW1 doesn't have enough sensors and computing power.
Hopefully June for those too
S for sure. It is a bigger car.
"I'd highly recommend upgrading to latest Model S (which is approx version 4). Only if you really want a smaller sedan, should you get a 3."
"Maybe I'm misinformed, but I was told that 30% of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn't yet exist in India to support that."
"Yeah, control algorithm is safe, but unpleasant. New one is even safer, but super smooth."
"Almost there, plus much improved web browser"
That will be tied to deliveries of the first production cars in July
Almost there. Probably in a few months.

Something cool for sure
Excited about the Tesla Autopilot software release rolling out next month. New control algorithm feels as smooth as silk.

Start taking orders in April
"Yeah, probably a year from now. S will still win on acceleration though, due to having more space for a larger battery."
"Only Model S will have the seven seater option, more cargo space, plus higher range, acceleration, two screens vs one, auto extend handles …"
The Model S produced today is arguably version 4. Let me put it this way: it is the car I will keep driving even after Model 3 arrives.
"If fate is on our side, it will be amazing. Will talk about that in detail next week."
No problem :)

"Yes, but not until next year"
Yes. Hardware already on all production S and X cars.
"Sorta. Model 3 is like a BMW 3 series or Audi A4. Model S is like BMW 5 and 6 series, but much faster, more storage space + Autopilot"
How about now?
Oh Model Y is coming too in a few years. Kinda have to.
All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves
Definitely
"Model 3 was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different :)"
Yes
"Model 3 is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range & power & fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology."

You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.
Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.

Exactly
"The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law."
The remedy for that is changing the law
"Ok, but what's up the wigs?"
There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don't know any that are better.
True!

I'm just saying that we should see what happens first. The actions may be surprising.
No they don't
Was wondering what those were
Sigh
That may be a difficult award to decline
"Tillerson also said that “the risk of climate change does exist” and he believed “action should be taken"""
"... on how to address threats of climate change. They do require a global response."""
"Tillerson at his confirmation hearing: ""I think it’s important that the United States maintain its seat at the table in the conversation ..."
"Ok, fine. Soldier 76. My dark secret is out ..."
I share The Economist's opinion that he should be given the benefit of the doubt unless his actions prove otherwise
"Rex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team. His team is now the USA."
"This may sound surprising coming from me, but I agree with The Economist. Rex Tillerson has the potential to be an excellent Sec of State."
There will be a software update this weekend that improves self-calibration ability
"3 months maybe, 6 months definitely"
"Yes, safety should improve significantly due to autonomy features, even if regs disallow no driver present"
"Auto steer limited to 45 mph on highways for now, i.e. heavy traffic, where it is needed most. Limit will raise as we get more data."
Autonomy capability should improve via OTA every 2 to 6 weeks
For now
"The 100D price takes into account exchange rate shifts, whereas other vehicle prices haven't yet been adjusted"
Yes. Block 5 is the final upgrade of the Falcon architecture. Significantly improves performance & ease of reusability. Flies end of year.
"If we applied resources to doing super complex retrofits, our pace of innovation would drop dramatically"
Tesla will never stop innovating. People are buying the wrong car if they expect this. There will be major revs every 12 to 18 months.
Yes
"Unfortunately, that would require stripping down the entire car and replacing 300+ parts. Wish there was an easy way."

Autopilot for HW2 rolling out to all HW2 cars today. Please be cautious. Some cars will require adjustment of camera pitch angle by service.
Validating a GPU driver fix and camera pitch angle health check for HW2
"Similar to SpaceX, the T is like a cross section of an electric motor, just as the X is like a rocket trajectory"
Our target is a 90% reduction with HW2 as the software matures
"Not specifically, but there have been several incidences of pedestrian and bicyclist lives saved by Autopilot"
It might. Am not sure.
Looking good so far. Should roll out this weekend.
Report highlight: “The data show that the Tesla vehicles crash rate dropped by almost 40 percent after Autosteer installation.”

It is
"Hopefully, early next week. Results from limited release look good so far. Trying our best to be super careful."
"Good point. 2.34 would be a production Tesla. Stripped down, maybe as low as 2.1."
It will
Promising early results from the Ludricrous Easter egg. Looks like 0 to 60 mph in 2.34 sec (Motor Trend spec) might be achievable...
"If the results look good from the latest point release, then we are days away from a release to all HW1 and to all HW2 early next week"
The least cool characters...it's embarrassing
It will in an upcoming release later this year
Tesla's approach to building an autonomy platform is focused on high compute efficiency machine learning. Primarily vision w radar & sonar.
Increasing capacity at existing Supercharger locations now has top priority. Some are overflowing while a nearby one is empty.
"Longitudinal control will, but lateral (steering) control will cap at 35 mph for a bit longer. Will raise after full fleet data rolls in."
"If all looks good, HW2 Autopilot functionality will switch from shadow to active mode by end of week for cars beyond initial 1000"
New rev for Autopilot HW2 rolling out Mon to first 1000 & to rest of fleet in shadow mode. Also improves HW1 and enables Ludicrous+.

Almost there. Undergoing final validation. Might go out in next few days.
Deus ex machina on the center screen when it ends
Occasional existential dread is inevitable if you think at all about the future
"Yes, grid won't be needed for moderate use Superchargers in non-snowy regions"
"A mere 350 kW ... what are you referring to, a children's toy?"
Brain is full right now and that's a hard one
"There are some installed already, but full rollout really needs Supercharger V3 and Powerpack V2, plus SolarCity. Pieces now in place."
"If you don't like the P100DL, you can give it back"
Good idea
Yes
"Should complete in 2017. One is def planned for Swift Current, near my cousin's wheat farm where I had my 18th bday."

"Some years away, but yes"
"Will be restored soon where there is a lead vehicle, ie you are being overtaken a lot due to true traffic speed being higher than the sign"
Night is easy. Twilight is hardest.
That is actually rolling out to all Model X's right now
Yes
"8.1, which hopefully goes out next week."
Hoping for next week. Also going through validation.
Looks like we might be ready to rollout most of Autopilot functionality for HW2 towards the end of next week

"also, the Tesla is poison free!"
all cars
can't always detect babies and pets
Can be turned on or off. V8.1 will allow always-on min and max temps to be set.
Tesla keeps temp below 40C/105F by automatically venting cabin & turning on AC when needed. Can do this for up to a year on a full charge.
My favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.
This is a major overhaul on almost every level compared to V7.

Particularly trying to understand the quieter bang sound a few seconds before the fireball goes off. May come from rocket or something else.
"Support & advice from @NASA, @FAA, @AFPAA & others much appreciated. Please email any recordings of the event to report@spacex.com."
Important to note that this happened during a routine filling operation. Engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source.
Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation. Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years.
It's been a little crazy lately
"yes. This seems instant from a human perspective, but it really a fast fire, not an explosion. Dragon would have been fine."
Finishing Autopilot blog postponed to  end of weekend
Loss of Falcon vehicle today during propellant fill operation. Originated around upper stage oxygen tank. Cause still unknown. More soon.
"Not allowed, according to HK regulations. Happy to do it if regs change."
We need to do one more minor rev on 8.0 and then will go to wide release in a few weeks

US is ~11 deaths per billion miles. WW is 17 deaths per billion. Autopilot already much better than either so far.
Unless we get there and find it isn't enough. Just won't be before 1B.
"It is extensively tested in the lab and in the Tesla test fleet. However, there is no substitute for real world experience."
"With less than 1B miles, there simply isn't enough data. 1B is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition."
"Thanks. Point of calling it ""beta"" was to emphasize to those who chose to use it that it wasn't perfect."

"that wasn't criticism, just clarification"
why?
thought I was posting Reuters. Copied the wrong link.
Probably six months. Will include hundreds of refinements to handle rare corner cases in Autopilot.

The Google term of self-driving would probably be more appropriate then.
"In other words, the intended implication is that a driver must remain alert, just as a pilot must remain alert."
"Tesla Tesla Autopilot is named after aircraft autopilot, as it is always expected that a pilot must stay alert."
"All publicly known Tesla product developments are called out, incl vehicles and batteries. Would be odd *not* to include."

Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff --  twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
"@elonmusk F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be 22,800 kg"
"@lukealization No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers."
@lukealization No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
@elonmusk Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload.
"@mattyteare Basically current, but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce 3 sigma reserve margin."

"@vicentes @gdoehne yes, several times"
@jbdeck for sure :)
@Tweetermeyer things like this should be purged shortly
@RokBottomGamers 100+ for almost everything 10+ for heat shields and a few other items.
@VivekMGeorge Zuck doesn't (yet) have a deep tech understanding of AI. I spend hours every week being educated by world's best researchers.
"@gdoehne JCSat is pushing the envelope as a very hot and fast mission, so will land on the droneship. Next land landing in a few months."
@MrBoylan System scan detected only 0.2% of orders with same email and physical address. Those have been purged.
@vigneshraju of course
@maya_kazan Temporary spike in some areas due to X 3rd row seat recall. Should be sorted by June.
"@MrBoylan Duplicates will be cancelled. Max of 2 will be delivered to any one person. Only ~5% of orders are 2, so speculation unlikely."
@erothenberg Simple answer is that there just aren't many used Teslas available. Demand >> supply.
@erothenberg checking into it ...
@romn8tr will definitely do so
"@abraham_cavazos some places are trickier than others, but yes. That's the value of having a PICA-3 heat shield with propulsive landing."
"@Cardoso It could land on Venus no problem, but would last maybe a few hours. Tough local environment."

"If speed at stage separation > ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h."
Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site

"@ID_AA_Carmack That works for Dragon, but hard to do for something long like Falcon"
"The flight grid fins look like the ones on this test we did, but larger: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DgLBIdVg3EM …"
@ID_AA_Carmack No choice. Entry velocity too high for a precision landing with N2 thrusters alone. Must have aero surfaces for pitch trim.
@John_Gardi Using legs as air brakes to drop terminal velocity in half requires slight redesign & more data. Maybe flight 21.
"Grid fins are stowed on ascent and then deploy on reentry for ""x-wing"" style control. Each fin moves independently for pitch/yaw/roll."
"Base is 300 ft by 100 ft, with wings that extend width to 170 ft. Will allow refuel & rocket flyback in future."

"Am not suggesting shutting down CO2 production, but rather to price in environmental cost & shift to sustainable energy"
"Even if the answer is only on the order of 1%, we should still take immediate action, as there is only one atmosphere."
Right question to ask Dyson or others: what is probability that human actions could cause catastrophic climate change?
What most serious scientists have a problem with is the notion of certainty about *any* subject. That is not the point.

"Yes, am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. Market will then achieve best solution."
"Trees are net consumers of CO2, so technically we would pay them money :)"
Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.
@MaxMBerger The collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator.
"Me & other private money funded Tesla for first 7 years, got IPO+ govt money for 3, now paid back. Yes, carbon tax would be a better way."

@MichaelLindahl It will be slightly smaller w fewer features as std. Think Audi A4 or BMW 3 vs Model S being S7 or M5
@DeanJFalkenberg yep
@Nezheim @jbmeicher sure :)
.@jbmeicher Model S works great in cold. Highest sales/capita are in Norway and we have a ton of customers in Canada.
"But when considering savings of gas v electricity, true cost vs gas cars is more like $25k for a v sweet ride"
.@benmacy $30k in 2013 $ (ie + inflation) w 200+ mile range w some really cool tech that we can't talk about yet.
".@joshj777 It has always been my dream to produce a low cost, compelling electric car. We are 3 to 4 years away. Wish it could be sooner."
